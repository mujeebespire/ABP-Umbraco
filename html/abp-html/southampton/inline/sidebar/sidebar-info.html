        <h4>Welcome to the Port of Southampton</h4>

        <p>The Port of Southampton plays a vital role in Keeping Britain Trading, handling £71 billion of manufactured goods every year.  As the UK's number one export port, approximately £40 billion of these goods are for export, 90% of which are destined for markets outside the European Union.  The Port supports over 45,000 jobs nationally and 15,000 locally.<br><br>

As an island nation, a huge 95% of our trade arrives or departs by sea.  We are one of the country's principal international gateways and home to the UK's 2nd largest container terminal.  This trade is dominated by the largest container vessels in the world, which can carry more than 23,000, 20-foot containers per journey.  Around 80% of the vessels arriving in Southampton travel on the Far East to Europe route.<br><br>

Southampton is Europe's leading turnaround cruise port. With five cruise terminals, the port is an establised cruise hub, and works with partners (waste services, fuel, logistics, deliveries, catering and stevedoring) to deliver a premium service to cruise lines enabling the Port to efficiently turn cruise vessels around in 12 hours and supports 3 million passengers per year.<br><br>

The port is a key automotive hub in Europe, served by 11 shipping lines providing direct access to 40 countries every month.  The port handles around 500,000 automotive units every year including heavy plant and machinery.<br><br>

Every year ABP Southampton is proud to sponsor the Southampton Marathon events, enabling thousands of runners to come together and raise money for good cuases.  The port is also heavily engaged in supporting a range of other charities.  Its current Charity of the Year is the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance.</p>
