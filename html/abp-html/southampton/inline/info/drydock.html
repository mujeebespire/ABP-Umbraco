			<h3>King George V Original Dry Dock</h3>
			<p>The King George V Dry Dock was opened in 1934, and was the 7th dry dock in Southampton.  At the time of construction, it was the largest dry dock in the world, a status it retained for thirty years.  The dock took two years to build and required the removal of two millin tonnes of earth.<br><br>

Surrounded by history, during the war, the dry dock was used for training commandos to familiarise themselves with the construction and later used for building the Bombardon breakwaters, used as temporary breakwaters to protect the Mulberry Harbours used in D-Day. The KGV dock is used by Solent Stevedores for bulk cargo.  The dock and the adjacent pump house are both listed buildings.
