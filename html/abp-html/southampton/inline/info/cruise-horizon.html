			<p>The Horizon Cruise Terminal opened in 2021. It is the newest cruise terminal with state-of-the-art green infrastructure including 2,000 roof-mounted solar panels and clean energy shore power for cruise ships.

Horizon Cruise Terminal is easily accessible from A33, West Quay Road, please follow signs for Dock Gate 10. Once through Dock Gate 10, the terminal is directly in front of you, take a right to reach the terminal.<br><br>
