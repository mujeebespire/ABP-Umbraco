The purchase provides future security and support for an important hub of UK food production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe multi-let industrial site spanning over four acres is located on ABP\u2019s Port of Grimsby in the Humber. The purchase of the long leasehold lasting 125 years, which ABP had previously granted to the owners of the complex, sees the acquisition add a new and highly complementary element to the Humber property portfolio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 70,000 square foot site comprises 21 units with several fish processing businesses including. In 2010 the complex was built and operated by the Great Grimsby Seafood Village Limited, the facility went on to win the North East Lincolnshire Economic Investment Award in 2014, recognising its vital contribution to the local economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAndrew Dawes, Regional Director of the Humber ports said: \u201CThe acquisition of the Grimsby Seafood Village strengthens Associated British Ports\u2019 commitment to Keeping Britain Trading.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt enhances our property portfolio with a vital hub for the UK\u2019s seafood supply chain - supporting regional jobs, boosting food security, and anchoring long-term supply chain resilience in the heart of the Humber.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003EGreg Lacey, Head of Property in the Humber added: \u201CThe acquisition of this site is a strategic addition to Associated British Ports\u2019 growing property portfolio, reinforcing our commitment to regional prosperity and underpinning food security. Pete and Gary leave an important legacy, and we look forward to taking stewardship of the facility and working with customers to support their ongoing operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWith over 158,000 small and medium-sized enterprises now thriving in Yorkshire and the Humber, this investment creates new opportunities for local businesses, strengthens the seafood supply chain, and supports our customer ambitions. It complements our bold expansion at the Stallingborough Interchange\u2014where we\u2019re investing in over 227 acres to deliver state-of-the-art port logistics, green energy, and industrial space - ensuring ABP continues to Keep Britain Trading.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPete Dalton and Gary Cadey, who created The Village said: \u201CWe would like to congratulate ABP on their acquisition of the site. The vision we had 15 years ago was to enable the merchants to remain on the dock area in a close community environment to enable them to work together in a modern facility. We feel that we achieved this very successfully and are happy to see our vision thrive and be able to continue well into the future. We wish ABP and all the tenants our very best wishes as we now take a back seat and slow down a little.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimon Dwyer, CEO, Grimsby Fish Merchants Association Limited, said: \u201CThe Grimsby Fish Merchants Association congratulate Associated British Ports on acquiring the Great Grimsby Seafood Village from its owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Village is an integral part of the Grimsby Seafood Cluster of over 5000 jobs, and we welcome the change of ownership. Our appreciation and best wishes go particularly, to Pete Dalton and Gary Cadey, for being the entrepreneurial pioneers of developing the Village for the many seafood businesses it\u0027s served for the last 13 years. The FMA look forward to working with ABP in continuing to deliver a top-class processing and distribution facility in the heart of their Port.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Humber region approximately 6,000 people are employed directly in the seafood processing sector and supports a wider supply chain of over 10,000 jobs. The Seafood Village is Grimsby\u0027s leading fish processing facility and experiences a consistent regional and national demand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E70% of the UK\u2019s seafood is processed in Grimsby making it a critical hub for national food security, which contributes an estimated \u00A32 billion annually. The site will continue to contribute to the growing and evolving food production industry cluster on the port, creating economies of scale and scope that all businesses in the cluster and the wider local economy benefit from.\u003C/p\u003E"
