ABP has also created a special series of floating keyrings carrying the \u2018Float to Live\u2019 message, which will be distributed to marine colleagues and boat owners to help them stay safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris Clouter, Assistant Port Manager at ABP\u2019s Port of Barrow and RNLI volunteer Press Officer and Launch Authority, commented:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CVolunteering with the RNLI is important to me because it feels like I am part of something much bigger \u2013 a lifesaving tradition. Knowing that I play a role in helping those in distress out on the water, so that they can return home safely and see their families and loved ones again, is truly rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAt Barrow, we are lucky to have two other volunteers for the RNLI working at ABP. Shaun Charnley, one of our Coxswains is also Coxswain of Barrow\u2019s Tamar Class All-Weather Lifeboat and Lindsey Cockburn, HSE Adviser, has recently taken up the role of RNLI Water Safety Officer at Barrow. We look forward to getting our floating ABP keyrings as constant reminders of the great work undertaken by all RNLI volunteers.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is also running a UK-wide family water safety poster competition for employees, encouraging them to imagine and illustrate a safe beach environment, applying the lessons from the RNLI\u2019s \u2018Float to Live\u2019 campaign. The winning and shortlisted entries will be displayed in an online gallery on ABP\u2019s website in time for the summer holidays. This will be done with the aim of raising awareness of safe water practices ahead of the warmer months which tend to encourage more swimming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the actual day of the anniversary, ABP IS inviting all vessels entering its ports and harbour authority areas to sound their horns to celebrate the vital work done by RNLI volunteers across the UK to save lives at sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike McCartain, Group Director Safety, Engineering and Marine, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CI would like to say a big thank you to all of our colleagues who give up their time to volunteer with the RNLI \u2013 you are true heroes. I too am a longstanding supporter of the RNLI and it is fantastic that here at ABP we are able to truly help spread the vital messages around water safety which do save lives.\u201D \u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela Rook RNLI Associate Director \u2013 Fundraising Media and Marketing, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe are delighted that mariners are supporting the RNLI by sounding their ships\u2019 whistles at noon on the charity\u2019s bicentenary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThis recognises the strong and lasting relationship between sea-goers and our volunteer rescue crews who have been saving lives at sea for 200 years. We hope, with the support of our kind and generous donors and their communities, they will always be able to do so. Thank you to ABP for co-ordinating this.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater this year, ABP will be supporting the official opening on a new RNLI lifeboat station, which the company sponsored at the Port of Barry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFind out more about the line-up of events planned to mark the RNLI\u2019s 200\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E anniversary and discover how you can get involved: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://rnli.org/about-us/our-history/2024\u0022\u003Ehttps://rnli.org/about-us/our-history/2024\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"
