      "content": "\u003Cp\u003EAssociated British Ports welcomed over 200 students to its Ocean Cruise Terminal to introduce them to careers in the maritime and transport sector.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe event brought together Maritime and Transport organisations to showcase career opportunities and apprenticeship programmes. Maritime and Transport Careers Programme (MTCP) managed the event after identifying a skills gap in the sector. Twenty schools from across the Solent including Portsmouth, Southampton, and the New Forest attended the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKatie Bruce, Engagement Officer for the Maritime \u0026amp; Transport Careers Programme, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022It was a great day to bring together organisations across the sector and promote the wide variety of careers available in the area to people who typically have not considered these sectors. This event will shine a spotlight on the huge variety of jobs on offer right on their doorstep and help attract the fresh talent needed to future-proof the Solent\u0027s impressive maritime and transport industries.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFifteen local maritime and transport organisations exhibited at the event, including DP World, Carnival UK, Red Funnel, Meachers Global Transport, Southampton International Airport, Tesla, Solent Stevedores, and Williams Shipping. During the two sessions, students had the opportunity to meet each organisation and learn about careers, apprenticeships, and graduate programmes; they also had the chance to speak to employees from each organisation during a speed networking session. Outside of the terminal, pupils were able to get \u201Chands on\u201D inside HGV cabins, the Tech Truck from Fareham College, and a Tesla car.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESindy Shakya, Head of Careers, Mountbatten School said: \u201C\u003C/strong\u003EWe are very keen to show students the many opportunities available to them on their doorstep. With the maritime industry predicted to grow 5% in 2025, it is important to make students aware of the different jobs and careers they can pursue in both the maritime and logistics industry and raise the profile of both sectors. Today\u2019s event at the ABP Cruise Terminal enabled students to have valuable conversations with different employers as well as trying their hands on the different equipment at the event. A big thank you to the organisers and employers present and we hope to attend again next year.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETom Dynes, General Manager of Landside Operations, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We were really pleased to be part of the day and host the first Maritime and Transport Careers event at ABP Southampton\u0027s Ocean Cruise Terminal. A fantastic opportunity to engage with young people across the region and inspire them to pursue a career in the maritime sector. The Port is an exciting place to work, filled with opportunities for young people to learn and thrive, and we enjoyed sharing a glimpse of this at the careers day.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"
