      "content": "\u003Cp\u003EAssociated British Ports (ABP) Southampton proudly supports local charities and great causes throughout the year. The organisation has already raised over \u00A312,000 for ANDYSMANCLUB through various social events and fundraising activities, including a charity cycle around the Isle of Wight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company also supports the Southampton Marathon event, and in 2025, it will be its tenth year as the headline sponsor. The event attracts thousands of runners and is a great opportunity for local charities to raise funds during the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of this activity, ABP Southampton has donated a further \u00A310,000 to three local maritime charities, including the Southampton Maritime Voluntary Service, Southampton Sea Cadets and Hamble Lifeboat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe funds from the latest donation have been raised through ABP\u0027s weighted heaving line Fund. A heaving line is a thin rope with a weighted end, such as a heaving knot or a throw bag filled with sand. When a vessel is unable to move close enough to the quayside, a heaving line is used as a proven method for ensuring the vessel ropes reach the shore. If a vessel arrives in the Port of Southampton with a heavily weighted heaving line, such as additional weights (metals) inserted at the end of the line. The ABP Team remove the additional weight from the line, and the vessel is charged for the issue of a throw bag filled with sand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP Southampton uses the funds raised to donate to local maritime safety charities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteve Masters, ABP Southampton Harbour Master, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We are really pleased to be able to contribute to local maritime charities as a result of an action which could cause a serious injury to our teams who work on the quayside or tugs. Thankfully, most vessels arriving in the port use safe heaving lines. It is important to charge those who undertake unsafe practices within the sector. It is a pleasure to support local charities who support our operations by providing additional watchful eyes and introducing the next generation to the maritime sector.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteve Collins, Head of the Southampton Unit of the National Maritime Volunteer Service (MVS), said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We were delighted to accept this contribution from the Port\u0027s Heavy Hauling Line charitable fund which we will use to subsidise the fuel and engine servicing costs for our two vessels, which are out on the water every weekend from March to December on harbour patrols in support of, and under the direction of the Harbour Master.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJames Godwin, Chairman of Hamble Lifeboat, said:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u0022We are delighted to receive this donation - these funds are extremely important to us. As an independent lifeboat charity, we rely on the generosity of the public and of local businesses and organisations who donate funds to ensure we can continue to operate the service we do. The money ABP Southampton has donated will go towards our new lifeboat fund. Our eldest lifeboat was launched nearly 30 years ago and is now reaching the end of her working life with us. Within the next couple of years, we hope to have a new lifeboat, and fundraising has begun in earnest toward that goal. A big thank you to the team at ABP Southampton and, of course, the Harbour Master, Steven Masters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESouthampton Sea Cadets said:\u003C/strong\u003E We were very grateful to receive a donation from ABP Southampton due to the weighted heaving line fund. We will use the donation for training equipment that will support us and inspire the next generation of Master Mariners. The young people attending Southampton Sea Cadets learn life and maritime skills and make many lifelong friends. Without the support of local organisations, we would not be able to provide as many activities as we currently do, giving the young people a head start in life.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"
