This event allows us to share our stories from the archive and examine buildings which have shaped our maritime story.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGarry Crossland, local maritime author and volunteer archivist of the ABP collection will deliver two talks as part of the 2025 event. He said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe architecture of many of the principal buildings on the Port of Grimsby estate replicate those influenced by the railways. This is reflected in the many engineers\u2019 drawings that are retained within the archives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe most iconic building on the port is the Dock Tower, and of course there are many buildings that were commissioned by fish merchants. As part of the presentation, we will display some of those drawings, which will show the ingenuity and vision of the Victorian engineers.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis year due to the major renovation works taking place within the historic quarter, a limited amount of bookable guided tours are taking place on Friday 12th, Tuesday 16th, Wednesday 17th and Thursday 18th September, and there are also options to attend a talk within Grimsby Port Office on Tuesday 16th or Thursday 18th September. The smaller events replaces the large Saturday event that is usually held as part of the Heritage Open Days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe buildings located within the historic operational area are part of a phased renovation programme of works, which has included surveying, structural assessments and external mapping to show the condition of the roofs and facades, before moving on to survey the interiors. The scheduled works will ensure buildings are wind and watertight, with repairs made to roofs, windows, doors and brickwork as required. As part of this many of the structures are cordoned off and streets closed for safety reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaces on the tours are limited.
