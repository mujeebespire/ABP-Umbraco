This will reduce grain claims and rejections, labour costs from integrated pest management (IPM) grain storage operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the existence of this robot, checking the moisture levels of piles of grain was a manual process, which is both time consuming and produces varying degrees of accuracy. It also increased the risk of avalanches when operatives had to climb up a stack of grain to take readings on moisture and heat. This robot enhances workplace safety because it has the ability to \u2018climb\u2019 to the top of a tall pile of grain and insert a metal rod vertically, which helps monitor the levels with a significant level of precision and eliminates the need for a manual process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDuncan Welberry, ABP Head of IT Business Partnering, Data \u0026amp; Analytics, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CSafety is a core value for ABP and because our ports naturally bring a wide variety of businesses across the supply chain together, they are ideal innovation hubs for developing tools and systems to enable safer workplace practices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThis grain-monitoring bot is the latest addition to our smart tech devices, which include drones, wearables and more. We are excited about this collaboration and look forward to seeing what lessons it can reveal for the wider farming and grain storage industry.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConnor Lyons, ABP Business Innovation Lead, commented\u003C/strong\u003E: \u201CBeing part of the creative R\u0026amp;D process is always immensely rewarding. The idea to integrate the CROVER robot was born by developing a deep understanding both of our customers\u2019 challenges but also the situations our colleagues in operations deal with everyday. I am proud that we have been recognised and rewarded a grant which will further accelerate innovation in this space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThis project is an excellent celebration of science in practice and with British Science Week coming up in March, it\u2019s a powerful reminder that ports are hubs for innovation and can offer a variety of exciting jobs from Engineering to R\u0026amp;D.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDr. Lorenzo Conti, Crover Founder \u0026amp; Managing Director:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe are delighted to have won this funding with ABP and are grateful to have a partner with the space, operations and vision to help us test this tool in a realistic environment and refine its capabilities.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project has been awarded \u00A3335K by Innovate UK as part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u2019 (Defra)\u2019s Farming Innovation Programme (FIP) fund. As the UK\u2019s innovation agency, Innovate UK helps businesses to grow through the development and commercialisation of new products, processes and services, supported by an outstanding innovation ecosystem that is agile, inclusive and easy to navigate.\u003C/p\u003E"
