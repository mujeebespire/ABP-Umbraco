Andrew will be drawing on 40 years of experience of the UK ports sector, accumulated through leadership roles all around Britain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost recently Andrew has spearheaded ABP\u2019s leading role in the successful bid for the Celtic Freeport, a transformational opportunity to grasp the investment and good jobs that should come from the UK\u2019s green energy transition and wider industrial decarbonisation. He has also been Chair of the East of England Offshore Wind sector group \u201DEast Wind\u201D as that region has also grown and developed its vital role in enabling offshore green energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAndrew\u2019s new role at ABP will help us continue our development of these, and other, projects as well as maintaining and developing excellent relationships with a broad range of senior external stakeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJulian Walker, ABP\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer, will formally take up the role of Regional Director, Wales and Short Sea Ports in addition to his role of Chief Commercial Officer from 1st July 2023.

There are some huge opportunities in areas like green energy not just for ABP but for a more sustainable UK as a whole. Realising these opportunities at scale is all about working in partnership and I\u2019m looking forward to working with stakeholders in both the private and public sectors to deliver a number of major projects in the current pipeline and looking at future opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe continued \u201CIt\u2019s been a fantastic 9 years at the Wales and Short Sea Ports business and I look back with real pride at the strategic progress of the business and with thanks to the tremendous people in the business I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to work with. I leave the business and its people in very safe hands with Julian Walker, who I\u2019m convinced will continue its strong trajectory.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJulian Walker\u003C/strong\u003E said \u201COur 16 ports and 600 people across the Wales and Short Sea Ports business handle almost every conceivable cargo, with several playing really key roles in the UK\u2019s green energy transition.
