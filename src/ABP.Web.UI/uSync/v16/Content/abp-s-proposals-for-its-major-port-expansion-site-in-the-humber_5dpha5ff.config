The planning application includes external storage and distribution of goods and products (Class B8) associated with port-related import-export activities; together with up to 12,000 square metres floor space of associated buildings, landscaping (including land for biodiversity net gain), infrastructure, ground mounted solar PVs and other associated works.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAndrew Dawes, Regional Director of the Humber ports said: \u201CThis strategic investment in the growth of our Humber ports continues to ensure we maintain a leading position in the port sector. Supporting our customers expansion is also critical as it assists the investment in the region for jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CDemand is expected to increase for energy generation, automotive storage, bulk warehousing, and storage and distribution uses and this new site will ensure the delivery of state-of-the-art infrastructure, facilities, and technological innovation for new and existing customers.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGreg Lacey, Head of Property (Humber) for ABP said: \u201CA year after the purchase of what is such a significant investment site, we bring to fruition our shared ambition to create a major UK port logistics development. This is part of the wider Stallingborough development that will deliver up to a further 1.5m sq. ft. of industrial and manufacturing space across the remainder of the site that benefits from an existing planning consent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe site is one of the largest development land parcels in such proximity to the ports, and of significant scale versus wider opportunities in the Yorkshire region. The sizeable investment we made in this shows ABP is a key player in supporting the growth of commercial activities within the region.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E70 acres of the site will be developed for the automotive sector to support the growth at the Ports of Immingham and Grimsby for both existing customers for import and export and new entrants to the market. ABP will be looking to start on site next year with the scheme. The remainder of the application provides high quality green landscaping areas to boost biodiversity and a phase of ground mounted solar panels to provide green energy to the development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a prime strategic location next to the A180 and located two miles from the Port of Immingham and six miles from the Port of Grimsby, the designated employment site is one of the largest of the original Enterprise Zones in the area and is key to future proofing the continued growth of ABP\u2019s commercial business on the Humber.\u003Cbr\u003EThe site has been allocated in the local plan for employment use since 2013. Also referred to as Pioneer Business Park (PBP), it has traditionally been used as agricultural farmland and is strategically positioned directly adjacent to the A180 dual carriageway, leading to Grimsby and local motorway networks. The site is also connected to the Humber Link Road, the new port connection road built in 2021 that links Immingham and Grimsby.\u003C/p\u003E"
