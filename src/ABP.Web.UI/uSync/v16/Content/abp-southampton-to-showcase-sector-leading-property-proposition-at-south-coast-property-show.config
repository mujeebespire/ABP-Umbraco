With over 8,600 acres, a portfolio of 1000 tenants and strategically located ports, ABP has a major commercial property portfolio and a uniquely diverse and compelling proposition. This will be the first time ABP Southampton has showcased at the event as the regional property team seeks to broaden its reach and appeal to new clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETim Hook, Lead Property Asset Manager, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe Port of Southampton is open for business to the property sector, with land available, we can offer bespoke property solutions with road, sea and rail links connecting occupiers nationally and internationally.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP Southampton has land available to lease and develop. In 2023, it acquired Solent Gateway Limited, the operators who manage Marchwood Military Port and plans to develop the port into new commercial space and increase its capacity to support MOD operations. Phase 1 of the development is nearing completion, providing 21 acres of outside storage space. Marchwood Industrial Park is situated on the western shore of Southampton Water, opposite the Port of Southampton\u0027s Western Docks. ABP is working with stakeholders and existing tenants as part of a phased regeneration programme.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERedbridge is a prime development site located in the heart of the Port of Southampton\u0027s Western Docks. The site falls within the Solent Freeport and is a confirmed tax site suitable as a customs site. ABP is analysing the best use for the 26-acre site with potential to develop up to 500,000sqft of space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the conference, ABP\u0027s property team will host a round table discussion on the future of the industrial sector, where ports will play a pivotal role in meeting occupiers\u0027 changing demands. They will also take part in a panel discussion on future industry trends from a landowner\u0027s perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIan Henderson, ABP Head of Property said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe are looking forward to meeting local manufacturing and logistics businesses and showcasing the port as a major landowner in the Solent. The port is well-connected throughout the UK and beyond to provide property solutions for both small- and large-scale operations, port-related or not, but certainly with a vision for greener operations to support the energy transition.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is keen to drive sustainable operations and transform available land into green growth hubs. ABP launched its \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019 sustainability strategy in 2023. The strategy helps to guide us as we create a more positive environmental impact from our own operations and work with our customers and port partners to jointly invest in new initiatives and partnerships to enable the energy transition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are already working with partners within ABP\u2019s Wales \u0026amp; Short Sea Ports and Humber regions to deliver new developments for floating offshore wind, low-carbon infrastructure projects, and green hydrogen. We can offer sustainable solutions to new and existing tenants in all three regions.\u003C/p\u003E"
