To bring this to life - in the same week as this meeting, we have seen the Secretary of State for Energy and Net Zero, Ed Miliband, open ABP\u2019s Lowestoft Eastern Energy Facility (LEEF), which will support both operations and maintenance activities and the construction of new offshore wind turbines in the North Sea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CFrom current offshore wind successes such as the expansion of Siemens Gamesa\u2019s offshore wind blade manufacturing facility at Green Port Hull to future opportunities to create prosperity, jobs and a green future such by supporting the development of floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea \u2013 ports have a significant role to play in making offshore wind targets a reality.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKey themes which came to the fore during the meeting, included:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENeed for pan-European approach\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 This applies especially in relation to port utilisation and capacity development planning. Adopting an integrated approach can help deliver greater efficiencies, insights sharing and accelerate the journey towards offshore wind targets. Climate change is a shared challenge which transcends national borders, further strengthening the case for international collaboration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContinued commitment to Offshore Wind in Europe\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 In the global race to become offshore wind leaders, European ports continue to expand their understanding of the future demand profiles for offshore wind requirements of port users. They are undeterred by recent turmoil caused by inflation, supply chain tension and higher interest rates which have affected some offshore wind projects due to rising costs. The Alliance of Major Offshore Wind Ports is firmly committed to overcoming these temporary challenges and believes there is a promising future for offshore wind in Europe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportance of strategic management of property portfolio\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 Offshore wind projects often have significant land and infrastructure requirements. This accentuates the importance of strategic management of port capacity to ensure optimal space planning and allocation to benefit all port users.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPort users are adopting a long-term view\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 Ports have observed an interesting trend in recent years involving port users, who are increasingly viewing ports as strategic assets and delivering a pipeline of projects rather than considering individual projects in isolation. Adopting a long-term approach to project management brings a host of benefits to port users, including more competitive rates, greater stability and the certainty of having the space they need to future-proof their operations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPorts continue to play a pivotal role in their customers\u2019 decarbonisation journeys\u003C/strong\u003E - Ports are planning and in many cases are ready to invest in infrastructure upgrades to decarbonise their own operations and help their customers reduce their emissions. However, to be able to unlock this potential, a clearly defined pathway and demand use case to make these investments in a timely manner, are needed.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Major Offshore Wind Ports Alliance is committed to sharing the above insights with partners, policy makers and wider industry to help catalyse collaboration, accelerate offshore wind project development and reap the significant economic and environmental benefits successful projects can bring for coastal communities and Europe as a whole.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Ports Alliance\u2019s next meeting will be at \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://windeurope.org/annual2025/exhibition/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EWind Europe\u003C/a\u003E (8-10 April), an annual industry event in Copenhagen, which brings together key players in the offshore wind supply chain.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMore information about the Alliance of Major Offshore Wind Ports in Europe and major projects taking place at its member ports, can be found \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://port-alliance.eu/partners/associated-british-ports/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E"
