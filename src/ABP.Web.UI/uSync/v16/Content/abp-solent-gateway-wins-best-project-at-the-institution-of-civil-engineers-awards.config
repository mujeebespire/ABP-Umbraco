      "content": "\u003Cp\u003EAssociated British Ports (ABP), along with project partners Boskalis Westminster, Knights Brown, and Ramboll, won the Best Project Asset Maintenance Award at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) South East Awards for the ABP Solent Gateway Marine Infrastructure project. This project successfully maintained and future-proofed the 40-year-old Falklands Jetty, ensuring its continued utilisation for current and future Ministry of Defence (MOD) and commercial operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2023, ABP acquired Solent Gateway, the operator of Marchwood Military Port, with plans for its development. The landside development, known as Phase 1, has been completed and includes 21 acres of open storage, a new security facility and port entrance, including 60 acres of off-site biodiversity net gain (BNG) within the New Forest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis project, known as Phase 2, will maintain the Falklands Jetty, ensuring it remains capable of accommodating a wide variety of vessel sizes for at least another 40 years. Backed by a \u00A317.5 million investment, the scope of works included deepening the berth, constructing two new dolphins, and \u00A0increasing the load capacity of the existing mooring bollard and fixed fender configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engineering team at ABP worked with local supply chain partners to tackle the project\u0027s complex challenges, including a strict winter schedule from December to March to minimise the impact on salmon migration and other marine ecosystems. Preserving the existing infrastructure was crucial to avoid building a new berth. Due to its location, most of the work - such as site investigations, and pile installations - was conducted over water. The project\u0027s complexity earned it the Best Project Asset Maintenance Award for 2025.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJason Boulter CEng MICE, ABP Engineering Project Manager, said,\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022I am incredibly proud to have led this project and to collaborate with our specialist supply chain partners to safeguard an existing asset that can continue to fully support both MOD and commercial operations at ABP Solent Gateway. Winning the award underscores our commitment and teamwork to deliver on time and achieve our goals. It has been a pleasure working alongside Boskalis Westminster, Knights Brown, and Ramboll.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese works enable ABP Solent Gateway to continue to accommodate commercial and military vessels, removing the current tidal and wind restrictions associated with the existing marine infrastructure. Thereby increasing the jetty\u0027s usage and improving the port\u0027s ability to berth vessels at all states of tide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaul de Jong, Boskalis Westminster Managing Director, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201C\u0027Boskalis Westminster Ltd were proud to be able to continue their longstanding working relationship with ABP Southampton and help deliver this upgrade to ABP Solent Gateway. After ensuring the area was free from UXO we were able to deploy backhoe, split hopper barges and trailer suction dredgers to ensure the berth and approaches were dredged in order for other works to continue. It was a pleasure to work with ABP\u0027s professional team.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike Crook, Knights Brown Divisional Director, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe were delighted to lend our expertise and be part of the team tasked with maintaining the Falklands Jetty and enhancing the port\u2019s facilities with the construction of a new breasting dolphin and mooring dolphin. For everyone\u2019s hard work and collaboration to be recognised with this industry award is a proud moment for us all.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELuke Bradley, Ramboll Director, said: \u003C/strong\u003EThis project has been challenging yet incredibly rewarding. We employed innovative methods to verify and enhance the capability of the existing structure, breathing new life into an aged asset. Close collaboration across the project team enabled us to develop ideas that meet the needs of both construction and operation. It is wonderful to see the team\u2019s efforts recognised with this award.\u003C/p\u003E"
