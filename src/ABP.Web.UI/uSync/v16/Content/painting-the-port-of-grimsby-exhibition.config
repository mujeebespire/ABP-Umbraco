Born in Cleethorpes, for the last two years he has been located on the port capturing the sights.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFamed for painting local heritage fishing scenes, this first for the port will see an exhibition showcasing the modern elements including offshore wind, and some of the work being undertaken on the buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon Bird, Regional Director for the Humber ports said\u003C/strong\u003E: \u201CTwo years ago, we were approached by Sam Delaney, of Creative Start, and Steve Ridlington, of WE1 Heritage with an ask, would we as port operator like an artist in residence? We\u2019d never had one before, but with all the exciting developments happening in the conservation quarter of the port, we agreed. It would be an acknowledgement of the vibrant artistic community who were being drawn to this place.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe paintings that Dale has produced are very colourful. He has captured the modern port, which is contrasted nicely with the port in its fishing heyday. It shows what a dynamic place it is and how Grimsby has moved forward from its fishing heritage.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDale Mackie, artist, who for the last 30 years has been painting and drawing dock landscapes, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CI was delighted when ABP offered me to be the first Artist in Residence. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without WE1 Heritage allowing me one of their studio spaces.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CThe exhibition shows the Port of Grimsby from its early days of being the largest fishing port in the world to becoming a major hub for global offshore wind and the leading automotive distribution centre. I\u2019ve been honoured that I have had the opportunity to access areas on the port and capture them.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003ESteve Ridlington, from WE1 Heritage who leases buildings on the port, said: \u201CWe are excited to see the artwork that Dale has put together. It has been a pleasure to host Dale in our studio for the last two years and share the artist in residence alongside ABP.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPeople can view the artwork at Coffee on the Docks, 2 Auckland Road on the port from Saturday 14th September as part of the Heritage Open Day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor more information on Dale visit his website here \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.dalemackie.com/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EDale Mackie\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E"
