The conversations highlighted that port jobs are open to all, offering varied and fulfilling careers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2018, ABP has been at the forefront of the ports sector\u2019s efforts to boost diversity, for example playing a pivotal role in the launch of the Women in Maritime Charter in collaboration with Maritime UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to gender equality ABP\u0027s wider, employee-led, diversity networks are instrumental, raising awareness of key issues, encouraging open dialogue, and bringing forth innovative ideas and solutions. These efforts contribute significantly to ABP\u0027s mission of being a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming organisation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested in finding out more about the opportunities available at ABP and join a team where you can be yourself at work every day, check out our latest job vacancies:\u00A0\u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://careers.abports.co.uk/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://careers.abports.co.uk/\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKarolina Jabrzyk, Humber Pilot 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E Class\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow long have you been a Humber Pilot for and what did you do before joining ABP?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been a Humber Pilot for six years now. Before joining ABP I worked on a variety of vessels including RoRo, passenger, reefer vessels, bulk carriers, and containers with a Master ticket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is involved?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery day is different on the Humber. We safety navigate vessels\u00A0within the Humber Pilotage Area. Adverse weather can create some of the most challenging conditions to work in, especially when boarding a vessel using its\u00A0pilot ladder.\u00A0Dealing with ship traffic and coordinating with the ships master and crew to manoeuvre their ship safety into a lock, and onto berths also present different challenges every day, but on the other hand the role of Humber Pilot is very fulling and brings me great joy. Whilst working at ABP I have been promoted to a 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E Class pilot meaning I can work on ships up to 11m draft and up to 40000 DWT.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy did you decide to become a\u00A0Humber\u00A0Pilot?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen working at sea I was often away from home for long time meaning I could not spend as much time with my family as I would have liked. I wanted to change something and be able to come home every day but\u00A0still work with ships. Piloting gave me both, so it was the perfect solution. I also wanted to try something else in my career.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat do you enjoy most about being a Humber\u00A0Pilot?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy being on the water, meeting and talking with people from various nationalities. I\u2019m also always learning and gaining new experiences every day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should women consider a career in the maritime industry?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaritime careers for women have developed quickly in the last few years. More women are now at sea than ever before and there are more reaching the rank of is ship\u0027s captain too. We can do this job and it is great to see more women in marine roles. ABP gave me this opportunity to work as pilot which has been brilliant and allowed me to find the work life balance I was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFiona Jolley, Vessel Traffic Service Operator\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow long have you been a Vessel Traffic Service Operator (VTSO) and what did you do before joining ABP?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been working at ABP since 2018 and I manage the safe and efficient movement of vessel traffic on the Humber, alongside another VTSO and an Assistant Harbour Master. We are the first point of contact for any emergencies that occur on the river, and we are also responsible for planning and organising pilot transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat did you do before working as a VTSO?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI started as a Deck Officer Cadet on bulk carriers and combination chemical carriers and stayed there until I became 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0Officer. I then moved to cruise ships and remained there up to the rank of Chief Officer. I came ashore as a Pier Master at Saltend. I then moved to VTS in 2019, as a VTS Operator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eareas of your role do you enjoy the most, and what kind of challenges are there?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the team that I work with, everyone is really supportive, and we all work well together. There are lots of variables involved in managing traffic on a complex river, and no two scenarios are the same, which is probably the biggest challenge of the role. There is a real sense of accomplishment dealing with those challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat would you say to those \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Econsidering a career in the maritime industry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested in pursuing a maritime career a cadetship is probably the best place to start, but a marine apprenticeship is another great way to get into the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy best advice would be to do lots of research in deciding who to do your apprenticeship or cadetship with, as you will gain different experience with different companies, and therefore, have different career opportunities in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENicola Appleby, Marine Information Officer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow long have you been a \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarine Information Officer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E and what did you do before joining ABP?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019m a Marine Information Officer in the Data Centre, working from the Humber Marine Control Centre in Grimsby. I joined ABP at the end of August 2023, after wanting a complete change of career and a new challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe role supports VTS and assists with the River Humber vessel traffic and pilot logistics. We work closely with agent\u2019s and receive their online notifications for most vessels arriving and departing on the Humber. This information is then inputted into PAVIS (Port and Vessel Information System), which then allows us to create a pilot order if required. We then ensure the timely allocation of pilots to vessels, with the efficient use of transportation to achieve this. We also assist in emergencies and incidents, as required, by the Assistant Harbour Master.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore this role, I was a primary school teacher and prior to that a police officer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat do you enjoy most about the role and what advice would you give to those \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Econsidering a career in the maritime industry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like meeting new people and thoroughly enjoy working as part of a team. Having the ability to work under pressure, is important when working as a Marine Information Officer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA career within maritime is a great industry to work in. The industry has such a diverse range of roles, that there\u2019s something out there to suit all skillsets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESamantha Hammond, Marine Operations Apprentice\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat were do you doing before starting your apprenticeship?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore starting the apprenticeship, I was a stay-at-home parent to my three children. Before this I worked in engineering for 10 years as an Instrumentation Technician at Novartis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat encouraged you to apply for a Marine Apprenticeship with ABP?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw an advert for a Vessel Traffic Service Operator back in 2021, but didn\u2019t have the right qualifications at the time, so I applied for the apprenticeship when it came up a few months later. I wanted a change of career from engineering and the apprenticeship would give me a good knowledge and qualifications to be able to change career. A retired Assistant Harbour Master was kind enough to give me a tour of Immingham and Grimsby control towers too which confirmed I had made the right decision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECould you tell us how the apprenticeship works and some of your favourite experiences so far?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe apprenticeship is (up to) three-years, with ten months college based studies at South Shields Marine school where you gain an Advanced Certificate in Nautical Science and a lot of other courses. The rest is training and familiarisation around the Humber Ports. There is an end point assessment at the end which I am currently preparing to undertake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have enjoyed all the placements around the Humber and meeting many people over the last 18 months. Some of the placements include berthing vessels in Immingham and Hull docks, surveying out on the river, embarking and disembarking pilots with the launch crew, engineering with the Marine Engineering Support Unit, Vessel Traffic Services, the Data Centre and many more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am currently pursuing my VTSO training as some of my favourite aspects of the college courses are part of daily life as a VTSO, it is a challenge every day as no two days are the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat have you enjoyed the most about your apprenticeship\u00A0so far?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have really enjoyed putting the knowledge I acquired at college into practice on the Humber, and learning about how all the departments work together to make the river run as efficiently as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat would you say to others considering a career in the maritime industry?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor anyone wishing to enter or change to a career to the maritime industry I would thoroughly recommend it. There are lots of women who work in marine based roles across the Humber and everyone is very welcoming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERachael Hope Humber Pilot 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E Class\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow long have you been a Humber Pilot for and what did you do before joining ABP?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI started with ABP in October 2018, initially as a trainee pilot for six months, I have been qualified now for just over five years. Prior to joining ABP I used to work on cross channel ferries between Dover and France.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy did you decide to become a Humber Pilot and what do you enjoy most about the role?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was recommended to apply for the job by a friend who was already working at ABP as a Humber Pilot, he was aware I was looking for a more challenging position.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring our \u0022shifts\u0022 we are on call for our 10 days of rostered work. This itself can bring challenges as our working routine is never set, potentially sliding from a day shift to a night-shift and back again over the course of the 10 days. No two days are the same, each and every ship is different, and the variety of ports we go to keeps us on our toes \u2013 it is a really rewarding role.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://careers.abports.co.uk/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ewww.careers.abports.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"
