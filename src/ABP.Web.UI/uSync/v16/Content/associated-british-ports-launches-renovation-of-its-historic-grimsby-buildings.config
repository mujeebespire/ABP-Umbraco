The work forms another part of the initial work to reimagine the future of this unique area of the Port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe buildings located within the historic operational area are currently being surveyed which includes structural assessments and external mapping to show the condition of the roofs and facades, before moving on to survey the interiors. Once all surveys are complete, a programme of work will be produced to ensure they are wind and watertight, with repairs made to roofs, windows, doors and brickwork as required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAndrew Dawes, Regional Director of the Humber ports said: \u201CThis work is a major undertaking to ensure these buildings remain sound. Our immediate priority is to keep everyone safe, so many of the buildings have been fenced off while the contractors are on site to allow them to carry out the job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe are trying to minimise the disruption while the work is being carried out, but our priority is safety at every stage.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGreg Lacey, Head of Property (Humber) said: \u201CThis work now being carried out will halt and reverse the tide of decay after many years. We have been in discussion with North East Lincolnshire Council and Historic England on the steps being taken regarding the future of this part of the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe are reimagining the area in different zones to see what it could look like and how it would work for different industrial clusters. We have committed a substantive investment to do this as we look to ensure the future of the location. It is proving to be of interest to many in the film sector and this is something we think works very well in Grimsby.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP has been working alongside North East Lincolnshire Council (NELC) and Historic England (HE) since 2017, and it was recently announced that a second round of funding for heritage regeneration on the port would commence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDavid Walsh, Principal Advisor Partnerships at Historic England said: \u201CHistoric England is pleased to be working closely with Associated British Ports and North East Lincolnshire Council in support of a long-term strategy to tackle buildings in poor repair on the historic docks. Recent preliminary works to a number of priority buildings are an important first step towards making them safe, bringing them back into good repair, and reusing them to support local businesses and port activities.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Partnership Schemes in Conservation Areas (PSiCA) grant scheme has seen more than \u00A31 million help tenants restore and renovate buildings, including Alfred Enderbys, The Great Escape and others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP has allowed for heavily incentivised landlord funding to bring the buildings back into use.\u003C/p\u003E"
