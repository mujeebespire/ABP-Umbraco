The Partnership Scheme in Conservation Area (PSiCA) repair grant will now allow them to re-render external walls, repair windows, replace cast iron rainwater goods, and reinstate the flagpole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe grant scheme is a joint project between Historic England and North East Lincolnshire Council, with support from ABP and the council\u2019s regeneration partner EQUANS and is designed to preserve and enhance Conservation Areas such as the Kasbah which sits within the Greater Grimsby Heritage Action Zone (HAZ).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimon Bird, ABP Regional Director for the Humber ports said: \u201CIt\u2019s great to see another business taking on a building to bring it back to life. The Kasbah is emerging as a vibrant place and with the repair work being carried out it\u2019s becoming an attractive area for people to move their businesses to.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESteve Ridlington, Managing Director of WE1 Group Heritage, said: \u201CWe are extremely excited to be involved with the Grimsby Heritage Action Zone and everything that is happening at the Port of Grimsby. We started renovating two properties on the docks in August 2021 and we now have twelve properties under restoration, we have six clients moving into three of our renovated workspaces this year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThis is an amazing place to be, you are surrounded by so much rich history and the architecture is so inspiring, this is a really exciting time for Grimsby and we feel privileged to be associated with ABP and the Heritage Action Zone.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECllr Tom Furneaux, Portfolio Holder for Tourism, Heritage and Culture at North East Lincolnshire Council said: \u201CWe must look to a positive future for Grimsby and with the changes planned for our town centre and beyond, that will happen. In doing so, we must take our heritage with us where we are able \u2013 remembering where we have come from in order to grow. When we see schemes such as this, there is evidence that this is indeed happening. It is also a fantastic example of the council and its public sector partners working with businesses to successfully bring about change in one of our most historic and important areas.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELouise Brennan, Midlands Regional Director, Historic England said:\u201D I am delighted to see the start of the first repair scheme in the docks funded through the Heritage Action Zone. I am looking forward to the transformation of the historic docks with further projects scheduled for 2022 and 2023. Partnership working between public and private sector is key to regenerating this amazing place, with WE1 Group leading the way with the former Consolidated Fisheries building.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe building, which until March 2021 had been operated by George Herd, will re-open as the Black Gull Caf\u00E9.
