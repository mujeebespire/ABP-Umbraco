It was attended by representatives from Humber Energy Board member companies Equinor, Harbour Energy, Humber Freeport, Phillips 66, Prax, RWE, SSE Thermal and Uniper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers of the board and the region\u2019s MPs are focused on working with the Government to find a solution to unlocking the \u00A315 billion investment in the Humber, as a strategically important national asset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business leaders stressed to Lord Callanan that decarbonising the region is critical for the development of the local and national economy, skills and job creation and retention, energy security, and for the Government to meet its target of the UK being net zero by 2050.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMr Gwilliam\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CClimate change is the defining challenge of our time, compelling us to decarbonise our economy, develop energy resilience and invest in new green technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe Humber Energy Board is determined to make the Humber the world\u2019s leading net zero industrial cluster. By working together under the shared banner of the Humber 2030 Vision, we\u2019re ready to grasp this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and deliver the UK\u2019s green revolution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe have the platform, infrastructure and collective will to make this happen \u2013 but we need clarity and certainty from the Government, most urgently on pathways to deploy carbon capture and storage technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s essential we have a pipeline network to remove CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E from traditionally carbon intensive industries like power generation, steelmaking, chemicals and refinery, and deliver hydrogen to enable the switch from fossil fuels at scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe simple fact is that now is the time to deliver.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Humber\u2019s ambitions received a setback in March this year when none of the region\u2019s major decarbonisation projects were selected for investment in the Government\u2019s Track One funding announcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, successful projects were limited to the North West and North East. It meant the potential \u00A315 billion investment by private sector companies in the Humber is effectively on hold, until the Government announces the level of support it will commit to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Humber Energy Board estimates as many as one in 10 jobs within the region can be retained with this investment. However, there are fears private funding will be lost overseas if the Government does not include significant financial support for Humber projects in the next round of funding. This is expected to be announced within weeks, potentially as part of the Autumn Statement on November 22.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo view the Humber 2030 Vision, go to \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022http://www.investhumber.com/documents/HED-Brochure.pdf\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ewww.investhumber.com/documents/HED-Brochure.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"
