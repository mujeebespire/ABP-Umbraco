The long history the area has played in powering and fuelling the nation, alongside the many traditional industries which have for generations have operated in the Humber, has not only made the area crucial the country\u2019s economic success, but has also been contributing to the UK\u2019s climate change challenges. However, those challenges also provide the most exciting opportunity. Clearly, if the UK is to decarbonise effectively, it will require the Humber to lead the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBig business and political parties of all colours agree that green energy and carbon capture are fundamental to future growth. Last year the Humber Energy Board launched its 2030 Vision, which sets out \u00A315 billion worth of private sector investment from 18 projects that will all provide a cleaner and more sustainable way to power and fuel the nation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a key service and infrastructure provider, it is perhaps not surprising that the Humber Ports are involved in almost all of those projects. Events have moved at pace during the year since that Vision was first published, including an application for a Development Consent Order for a new Green Energy Terminal in ABP\u2019s Port of Immingham. If approved, the new facility will import ammonia for producing green hydrogen as a clean fuel source, delivered by ABP\u2019s partner Air Products. It could provide enough hydrogen to fuel 20,000 HGVs. The terminal would also have the potential to serve as an import and export terminal for captured carbon and could support key businesses like local refineries and power stations in reducing their carbon footprint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project is just one of the many ways in which ABP\u2019s ports are helping to support many of many other businesses as they seek to provide a green and sustainable alternative for our country\u2019s energy production needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Humber Ports also play a crucial role in supporting the offshore wind sector. This effort includes the expansion of Siemens new building in Green Port Hull for manufacturing offshore wind blades, added to the arrival of RWE for the Triton Knoll offshore wind project and the continuing growth of Orsted, both in the Port of Grimsby which is now the biggest hub in the world for the operations of offshore wind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP has also been investing in its own assets including creating the two largest roof-mounted solar facilities in the UK in the Ports of Immingham and Hull, and investments in new electric cranes, electric forklifts and electric vehicles as the ports steadily replaces equipment with green alternatives. ABP also has plans for new onshore wind turbines in Grimsby, Hull and Immingham as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen taken together, it is clear to see that the Humber, as the most carbon polluting area of the UK, is at the forefront of the green energy revolution and ABP ports are at the centre of the action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.abports.co.uk\u0022\u003Ewww.abports.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022/media/cqnejqnp/abp-humber-director-simon-bird.jpg?width=212\u0026amp;height=318\u0026amp;mode=max\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022 width=\u0022212\u0022 height=\u0022318\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"
