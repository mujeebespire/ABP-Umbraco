The race has far-reaching benefits for those involved and the local community at large who come out in force to support over 2000 runners, and 350 volunteers the day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother benefit of the race is all the charities it supports, not only does it support the Cleethorpes RNLI there are lots of smaller charities that also get involved, and their efforts are rewarded with a donation.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP have also been Platinum Partners of Hull and East Yorkshire Children\u2019s University for three years and have supported the charity for over a decade. The charity works with children growing up in disadvantaged areas of Hull and East Yorkshire who may not have the same opportunities as others. They organise visits to London, sleepovers at the Natural History Museum and visits to local businesses to learn about different industries. Their work aims to broaden children\u2019s horizons and raise aspirations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the Platinum Partnership, ABP sponsored an experience to Edinburgh for a class of 30 children. The children travelled by train and set up camp in a hall next to the iconic castle, before visiting exciting attractions such as Camera Obscura, Dynamic Earth and of course Edinburgh Castle. The children even got to try out some Scottish dancing. An experience to remember for a lifetime!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECEO of Hull and East Yorkshire Children\u0027s University, Rose James said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe support ABP Humber has given our charity over the years as partners has given us the opportunity to reach thousands more children. In the 10 years that ABP has been involved with our charity we have increased the number of children we support from 1,800 to over 11,000. Our partners have played a huge part in this, and we are incredibly grateful for ABP Humber\u2019s ongoing support.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis year ABP also announced a new partnership with Immingham Museum.
