Kirk Hill Wind Farm is their second project, and is thought to be the largest consumer-owned wind farm anywhere. Once constructed it will be made up of eight turbines, and take less than 10 minutes to generate enough electricity to power a typical home for a whole year and save 31,760 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESarah Merrick, Founder and CEO, Ripple Energy said:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CKirk Hill is the biggest addition to our wind farm family, and we\u2019re delighted to have reached this exciting milestone in the project, which is expected to be completed in early 2024.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt was a precise operation to discharge such large cargo from the vessels, which was expertly handled by a skilled team at ABP and in collaboration with the crane operators from Forsyth and hauliers from Collett.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAndrew Harston, Regional Director, Wales and Short Sea ports, ABP said:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAs part of ABP\u2019s commitment to supporting the acceleration of the UK\u2019s energy transition, we are pleased to be able to provide the necessary port infrastructure to support the delivery of an important project, which is helping to meet net zero targets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CABP itself has committed to becoming a Net Zero business by 2040, as well as to supporting our customers to achieve their own decarbonisation ambitions, and to achieve these goals collaboration is key, which is why we are pleased to be working with Ripple Energy to support the development of a new energy infrastructure in Scotland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CABP is also pleased to have the space to accommodate the safe storage of the turbines and blades until they are ready to begin construction.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe delivery of this project, through ABP\u2019s Port of Ayr, comes after the port recently supported the delivery of Vattenfall\u2019s South Kyle wind farm, made up of 50 turbines in East Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway.\u003C/p\u003E"
