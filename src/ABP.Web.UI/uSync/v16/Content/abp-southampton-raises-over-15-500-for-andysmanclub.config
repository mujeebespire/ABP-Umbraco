This charity provides a safe space for men to discuss their feelings and challenges. It has four local clubs in the region, including Southampton, Eastleigh, Gosport, and Totton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETeams at the port have taken on various fundraising activities, such as the Isle of Wight Cycle Challenge, and abseiling down the Spinnaker Tower. Port customers and local community members also helped raised the funds by attending the quiz night last March and a carol concert in December.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EANDYSMANCLUB, established in 2016, meets every Monday night across the UK, and its free to attend. However, maintaining the clubs often incurs costs, such as venue hire and refreshments, the funds raised at ABP will be used to support the running cost of the clubs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETom Dynes, General Manager of Landside Operations, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022Having worked in a Port environment, I understand that men often struggle to open up about their feelings and issues. Partnering with ANDYSMANCLUB as our charity of the year has been a positive experience. Not only have we promoted the use of ANDYSMANCLUB, but we\u0027ve also emphasised that it\u0027s okay to talk, which is the core mantra of the charity. Raising this significant amount of money has been enjoyable with lots of engagement across our teams.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETanya French, Head of Events at ANDYSMANCLUB, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We are incredibly thankful for the efforts of the ABP team in raising such a substantial amount in a short time and helping to raise much needed awareness. Funds raised through corporate support are vital for us to run as many clubs as possible and to help support that #thatoneman in his time of need. We are really happy to announce that we will be opening 50 clubs in Q1 this year, which is incredible, as originally, we hoped for 10 clubs in 5 years. We hope to see some of you at ABP Southampton marathon in April.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"
