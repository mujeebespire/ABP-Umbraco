These proposed upgrades to the Marina, pending planning approval, are set to transform the marina\u2019s facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen ABP announced its original proposals in June 2023, it originally involved removing all berths at the old Neptune Marina and installing new pontoons with access from the island site instead, some boat owners were opposed to moving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing meetings with boat owners and other stakeholders, ABP has developed compromise proposals, which are the proposals that have been submitted for planning approval.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese new proposals include investment in two purpose-built welfare buildings exclusively for boat owners, one close to Neptune Quay and the other on the island. Each will include toilets and showers, laundry facilities and other services for mariners. There will also be a large space for a new Window Museum for Ipswich Maritime Trust to tell the story of the port and town.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022fab6k8g\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EABP\u2019s Divisional Port Manager, Paul Ager\u003C/strong\u003E, said: \u201CWe want the Beacon Marina to be welcoming for boat owners and visiting crews. We are making a major investment in Ipswich as a destination and want it to thrive. We have gone some way towards answering boat owners\u2019 concerns. Waterfront visitors on the quayside will still be able to see a variety of craft moored here.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of these changes would not have required planning approval. However, the port operator has applied to Ipswich Borough Council for the elements that need permission. That planning application can be found on the Ipswich Borough Council planning portal \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ipswich.gov.uk/content/view-and-comment-planning-applications\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.ipswich.gov.uk/content/view-and-comment-planning-applications\u003C/a\u003E. Ref: 24/00476/FUL (Wet Dock Neptune Quay Ipswich Suffolk).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMr. Ager added: \u201CThese proposals are a compromise, based on the comments we have received from owners and talking to other businesses who have invested in the successful Waterfront area. The Neptune pontoons needed significant investment. We will now place a section of the new pontoons in the corner, in front of Coprolite Street and the main university building. But they will not extend as far as the Salthouse Harbour Hotel and Isaacs. There will be a pontoon there available for visiting craft, including historic vessels, to tie up.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP remains dedicated to seeing the Waterfront thrive and reinforcing Ipswich\u2019s identity as a vibrant Waterfront town. ABP has proudly sponsored local events, such as the Twilight 5K and the Dragon Boat Race, which attract numerous visitors and showcase the marina\u0027s potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe are playing our part in helping make Ipswich an attractive place for owners to visit as tourists, or to keep their boats or to live on board in the marina, close to the heart of town. Ipswich remains a major commercial port and the number one export port for agricultural products in the UK. ABP\u2019s commitment to Ipswich extends beyond the marina. With the support of our customers, we make a major contribution to the local economy, and ABP has invested more than \u00A350 million in commercial port facilities in Ipswich since 2012. This should highlight ABP\u2019s dedication to fostering economic growth and prosperity in the region,\u201D Mr. Ager said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to note that this proposal is still subject to approval from the ABP board and Ipswich Borough Council. ABP will ensure that all stakeholders are updated on the progress and any forthcoming decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESubject to planning approval, the earliest possible commencement date for these upgrades is the beginning of 2025. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E"
