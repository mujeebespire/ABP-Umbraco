One of these will be located close to Neptune Quay and the other on the island. Each will include welfare facilities, such as toilets and showers, laundry facilities and other essential services for mariners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the plans include the creation of a dedicated space for the Ipswich Maritime Trust\u2019s new Window Museum, celebrating the town\u2019s rich maritime history. Modern conveniences such as upgraded Wi-Fi and other enhancements will also be introduced as part of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Ipswich Maritime Trust\u003C/strong\u003E welcomed the plans, stating: \u201CWe\u2019re thrilled at the prospect of expanding our ability to showcase Ipswich\u2019s rich maritime history. If these upgrades are approved, it will create exciting opportunities to connect the community with the port\u2019s historic legacy.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe investment is a cornerstone of ABP\u2019s commitment to maintaining Ipswich Waterfront as a key feature of the town and sustaining the marina\u2019s prestigious Five Gold Anchor status, awarded earlier this year by The Yacht Harbour Association (TYHA).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo facilitate these improvements and ensure safety, ABP has made the necessary decision to relocate 39 vessels currently berthed on the northern side of the marina to the opposite side of the Wet Dock ahead of the winter period. This decision comes after a thorough inspection, which confirmed that the existing pontoons on the northern side have reached the end of their usable life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaul Ager, Divisional Port Manager (East Anglia) at ABP,\u003C/strong\u003E said:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re thrilled that the ABP Board has approved this significant investment in Ipswich Beacon Marina, a strong vote of confidence in Ipswich Waterfront. These plans reflect feedback from customers, stakeholders, and the wider public, who have expressed strong support for upgrading berthing facilities on the northern side of the Wet Dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CSafety is always ABP\u2019s top priority. While we understand the relocation may cause disruption to some vessel owners, this decision is necessary to ensure the safety of marina users and our team. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible and our marina team is personally reaching out to affected berth holders and providing support on-site at the former Neptune Marina office.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP submitted its planning application for the marina upgrades to Ipswich Borough Council in July 2024. Subject to approval, construction is expected to begin in early 2025, with the project expected completed by the summer of 2025. ABP will keep berth holders and the wider community informed of progress and next steps as the project advances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis development represents ABP\u2019s continued dedication to investing in Ipswich\u2019s vibrant waterfront, ensuring it remains a landmark destination for both residents and visitors.\u003C/p\u003E"
