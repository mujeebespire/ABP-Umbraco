This milestone comes just ahead of the completion of significant upgrade works at the port, which are set to be finalised in just over a month\u2019s time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first sailing of the Pont-Aven took passengers from Plymouth to Roscoff in France, marking the beginning of another exciting season of travel between the UK and continental Europe. Millbay Docks has been a key hub for Brittany Ferries for over 50 years and includes daily services to Roscoff in France, as well as twice-weekly service to Santander in northern Spain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAshley Curnow, Divisional Port Manager at ABP\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CWe are thrilled to welcome Brittany Ferries back to Millbay. The upgrades we\u2019ve implemented over the past year are a testament to ABP\u2019s dedication to improving our facilities and services. We look forward to seeing the positive impact these changes will have for passengers.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00A323 million transformation of Millbay Docks has included the strengthening of the West Wharf, the installation of a new passenger boarding bridge, an upgrade to the terminal building, and other enhancements designed to provide a more efficient and enjoyable experience for all passengers traveling through the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWorks to upgrade infrastructure at Millbay, which began in December 2023, are intended to help secure the long-term future of the Ferry Terminal, strengthen the port\u2019s freight capability, increase the port\u2019s green credentials and grow the offering to the cruise market. The strengthening of West Wharf works has involved the installation of 30 steel tubular piles, which means the West Wharf now has a 60-metre area capable of accommodating 100-tonne cranes, significantly increasing the load capacity of the berth. This strengthening of the West Wharf has been integral to enabling subsequent works to happen \u2013 the initial strengthening works were funded by the UK Government as part of the Plymouth and South Devon Freeport seed capital programme.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is part of a series of strategic infrastructure developments at Millbay to secure the long-term future of the ferry terminal, improve passenger experience and strengthen its freight capability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteve Lawrie, Port Operations Manager at Brittany Ferries in Plymouth\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CWe are delighted to resume our services from Millbay, a port that has been central to our operations for over five decades. The recent major upgrades by ABP will undoubtedly enhance the travel experience for our passengers and support our commitment to providing high-quality services. We look forward to a successful season ahead.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: center;\u0022\u003E- Ends -\u003C/p\u003E"
