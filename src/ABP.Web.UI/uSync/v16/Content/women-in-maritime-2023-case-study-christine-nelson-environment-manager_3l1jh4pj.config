I have the pleasure of not only working closely with my W\u0026SSP Compliance colleagues, but also with our local and regional colleagues in Engineering, Property, Marine, Projects and Operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn any given day I could be meeting our environmental regulators, analysing dredge sediment sample data for one of our Harbour Masters; advising commercial and operations managers on the relevant environmental permits; exemptions and cargo storage relating to a new business opportunity; or investigating biosecurity, drainage, air quality, recycling and hazardous waste storage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best part of my job is being able to get out onto all the ports and delve into all the (clean and dirty) nitty gritty of things. I\u2019m still in awe of our pilots and how they board and manoeuvre foreign ships into our ports. The huge volumes of cargo that we handle also never fail to impress me \u2013 walking through sheds full of animal feed, wood pulp and steel, and watching our operations colleagues carrying out loading activities will always inspire me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat did you do before joining ABP? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019ve always loved the sea and water sports, so my degree in Marine Geography at Cardiff University was a perfect way to combine my interest in physical geography. As part of my degree I did my third-year industrial placement on the Dover Harbour Board at the Port of Dover. I was the Environmental Assistant there for a year before returning after graduating to the position of Environmental Manager. Whilst in Dover I set up the ISO14001 environmental management system and managed our in-house environmental monitoring program. I also started the environmental impact assessments for what is now Dover\u2019s new Western Docks Terminal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComing from a Trust Port that deals with passengers, ferries, freight and cruise was very different to the varied cargo operations and multiple sites across ABP, but gave me a good feel for the diversity of the ports industry and the importance of environmental management systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was really lucky when the position came available at ABP and I was able to base myself near my home in Barry, South Wales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are some of the challenges and how do you overcome them? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur 16 ports in the Wales \u0026 Short Sea region are based across England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 all of which have different interpretations of environmental legislation, and so our online legal register is a really valuable tool for me to keep on top of legal updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest challenge used to be trying to get the message across that protecting the environment isn\u2019t just a nice thing to do. Thankfully that\u2019s not my biggest challenge anymore, everyone realises that environmental compliance is so important. Right now, climate change is our biggest challenge and this is going to affect the whole industry in terms of the different cargoes that we handle, the fuel we use, and how we develop and use our marine and terrestrial spaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it feels overwhelming to look at the big picture, and I worry about the future environment which I\u2019m bringing my children into \u2013 but there\u2019s no time better than today to make improvements for tomorrow, and I have a great team of colleagues and together I believe we can make a difference to reduce our environmental impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat have been some of your highlights working for ABP? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI joined ABP in a group role which I did for six years, before covering the Wales region, and then the Wales and Short Sea Ports region. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ve built up good working relationships and friendships with colleagues across the business \u2013 it\u2019s definitely the people that make a place a joy to work in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA colleague recently told me that we are simply custodians of our ports, some of our ports have been around since the Victorian era, we are simply looking after them for the next generation. The highlight for me is the varied nature of the business and the fact that we have to keep moving with the times \u2013 whether that be changes to the economy or adapting to climate change. I\u2019m really excited about the biodiversity improvement commitments that we\u2019re going to be legally obliged to fulfil. It will be a great opportunity for employee engagement projects and to get everyone involved across our ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother great thing that ABP has got to offer is its employment opportunities \u2013 whatever your interests, whether they may be on land or at sea \u2013 not to mention at \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.abpmer.co.uk/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EABPmer\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.ukdredging.co.uk/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EUK Dredging\u003C/a\u003E, there\u2019s something for everyone.
