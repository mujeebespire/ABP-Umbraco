Jean\u0027s House was the focus of the organisation\u0027s Charity of the Year in 2023.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETeams at the port have taken on challenges throughout the year, including the Three Peaks Challenge, Southampton Marathon, London, New York, and Boston Marathons for one keen runner, Bake Offs and Movember. The Port also organised car parking for visitors to the Southampton Boat Show and a Christmas Carol Service for the local community to raise money for the charity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJean\u0027s House was established in 2018 and offers free accommodation to families whose child is affected by cancer and is receiving treatment at Southampton General Hospital. Jean\u0027s House is within walking distance of Southampton General Hospital, which means families can stay together during critical times. With an average of 80 miles per single trip to receive the treatment, it is vital that families are offered this type of free accommodation, particularly when parents are often unable to work during the treatment plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlastair Welch, ABP Regional Director, said\u003C/strong\u003E: \u0022We are proud to support local charities as part of our charity of the year initiative and make a big difference to those who need it the most. Jean\u0027s House is an inspiring home that enables parents to stay close to their children during treatment and offers accommodation for siblings to stay. It is particularly important to keep families together at such a devastating time.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiz Blunt, Young Lives vs Cancer Senior \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFundraising Engagement Manager said\u003C/strong\u003E: \u201CIt\u2019s been wonderful to work with the fantastic staff from ABP Southampton and I am very grateful to their employee and our volunteer Caitlin for nominating us to be their Charity of the Year for 2023. Our research shows that whilst a child is having treatment for cancer, a family needs to find on average an extra \u00A3700 a month. I have heard on countless occasions from parents that they don\u2019t know what they would have done without being able to stay at Jean\u2019s House. We don\u2019t receive any government funding so a massive thank you to ABP Southampton for helping to ensure that families have a home to stay in, with the huge amount they have raised.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E"
