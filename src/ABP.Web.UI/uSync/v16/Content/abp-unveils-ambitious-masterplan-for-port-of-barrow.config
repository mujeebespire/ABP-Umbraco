It describes how Barrow is poised to take advantage of significant long-term investment, driven by its crucial role in meeting the UK\u2019s obligations under the AUKUS partnership and in achieving net zero emissions by 2050. ABP\u2019s masterplan will ensure that the Port of Barrow is equipped to meet these challenges by expanding its capacity and capabilities across key sectors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBryan Davies, Divisional Port Manager (Northwest and Scotland) at ABP said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CABP is proud to be part of Barrow\u2019s future by helping to create the facilities needed to support the advanced engineering cluster. Our masterplan ensures that this development benefits not only the industry but also the local community and environment, and supports ABP\u2019s wider sustainability strategy \u2013 Ready for Tomorrow.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMichelle Scrogham MP for Barrow and Furness said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CABP\u2019s masterplan is a visionary blueprint for the future of Barrow. The focus on sustainable growth, along with the port\u2019s role in supporting both advanced engineering and renewable energy, means this plan will have long-lasting benefits for our community. I am excited to see how these plans will deliver new opportunities for the people of Barrow.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe masterplan sets out three core objectives that position the town as a leader in advanced engineering and renewable energy, while fostering community and environmental sustainability. These objectives focus on delivering growth capacity for:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe advanced engineering cluster\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe net zero cluster\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Elocal businesses, communities and environments.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder the first objective, which aims to help build Barrow\u2019s capabilities in advanced engineering, ABP outlines how the port will respond to new demand created by the \u003Cstrong\u003EAUKUS deal\u003C/strong\u003E, which will make it critical for the port to expand its capacity to support the manufacturing and shipping of submarine sections. ABP has been working alongside BAE Systems to transfer land that will allow a major increase in BAE Systems\u2019 production capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, ABP will be working on the first major project from the masterplan \u2013 the \u003Cstrong\u003EBarrow EnergyDock\u003C/strong\u003E \u2013 which will soon be going to public consultation. This project will set the stage for a significant shift in green energy capacity primarily intended for Barrow\u2019s advanced engineering sector. The Barrow EnergyDock floating solar project would be a pioneering initiative designed to meet the growing demand for zero-carbon energy. The project proposes a floating solar array in Cavendish Dock, which can generate up to 32 MWp of green electricity, enough to power the equivalent of 10,300 homes each year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKirsten Abbott, Commercial Manager (Energy) at ABP said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CABP is incredibly excited about the Barrow EnergyDock project, which marks a major step toward meeting the green energy needs of Barrow\u2019s industries, and positioning Barrow as a forward-thinking industrial hub.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CABP is committed to working closely with the Council, local stakeholders and the public to ensure that the Barrow EnergyDock project benefits the entire community. A public consultation on the project will begin shortly, giving local residents and businesses the opportunity to engage with this transformative initiative.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second objective focuses on how the port will play a role in boosting the UK\u2019s wider journey to energy security and net zero. Barrow has already established itself as a key player in the offshore wind industry, serving as a home to five Operations \u0026amp; Maintenance (O\u0026amp;M) bases. ABP is planning for the construction of new O\u0026amp;M bases to accommodate the growing offshore wind sector, along with berths capable of handling larger Service Operation Vessels (SOVs). One such development is the Walney Channel O\u0026amp;M Base, where ABP has identified 4.7 acres of land adjacent to Ramsey Way. This site will provide the facilities necessary to support future wind energy projects, including warehousing, crew facilities, and marine access points for SOVs and Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlongside these O\u0026amp;M facilities, we expect to provide facilities for the construction process of the windfarms themselves, supporting the expected \u00A317 billion investments in wind energy expected to come to the Eastern Irish Sea under the Round 4 process. The expansion of these facilities will ensure that Barrow remains a leading hub for wind energy, anchoring high-skill jobs and growth in the local economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the masterplan includes exciting new proposals for maritime connections to support \u003Cstrong\u003Ehydrogen import and carbon storage\u003C/strong\u003E. As part of its broader commitment to achieving net zero, ABP has undertaken early feasibility studies on developing a new jetty capable of accommodating incoming gas carrier vessels up to 200m in length and with a capacity of 25,000 cubic metres. This jetty would be an essential piece of infrastructure will help to position Barrow as a key player in the UK\u2019s energy transition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third objective sets out ABP\u2019s specific plans to reinforce the local economy while moving to net zero, building biodiversity and strengthening communities. ABP wishes to contribute to stakeholders\u2019 wider efforts to make Barrow a more attractive place to live and work. This includes supporting proposals a new \u2018Skills Quarter\u2019 for the town and the Barrow Marina Village project, while maintaining ABP\u2019s wider community work such as the main sponsors of the annual Barrow Tall Ships event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECllr Jonathan Brook, Leader of Westmorland and Furness Council\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eand Cabinet member for the economy \u003C/strong\u003Ewelcomed the masterplan and called for collaboration to bring it to life: \u201CThis ambitious plan will be key to unlocking Barrow\u2019s potential. The Council is committed to working closely with ABP and other stakeholders to make this vision a reality. By joining forces, we can ensure that Barrow thrives and delivers benefits that will be felt across the region for generations to come.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP\u2019s masterplan for the Port of Barrow is a call to action for all stakeholders in Barrow to work together to ensure that the town not only adapts to new opportunities ahead, but thrives as well. With its commitment to enhancing engineering, renewable energy and sustainable growth, the Port of Barrow is set to become a critical driver of long-term prosperity for the region.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESee ABP\u2019s full Vision Paper and video at: \u003Ca href=\u0022/future-ports-barrow\u0022 title=\u0022https://www.abports.co.uk/future-ports-barrow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.abports.co.uk/future-ports-barrow\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E"
