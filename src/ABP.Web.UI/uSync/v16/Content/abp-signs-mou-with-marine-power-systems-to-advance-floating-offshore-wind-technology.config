The platform is designed to support the rapid deployment of industrial scale floating offshore wind whilst maximising local benefits and reducing both risk and overall project costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAndy Reay, ABP Head of Offshore Wind, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe are very excited to be working with MPS to assess this emerging technology and hope that it will help accelerate progress in developing the UK\u2019s floating offshore wind sector. We are particularly pleased to develop this relationship with a Wales-based company as we look to realise the potential of FLOW for jobs and investment in local communities.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more than 30 years, ABP has been delivering for offshore wind customers, with the ability to support the full offshore wind development cycle. One of the biggest clean energy opportunities for the UK is the development of Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW) in Wales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is planning to invest around \u00A3500 million to develop new and repurposed infrastructure in Port Talbot to enable the port to host manufacturing, installation, and supply chain activity for the Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW) sector. This has the potential to create 16,000 new, high-quality jobs and attract \u00A35.5 billion inward investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMartin Carruth, Commercial Director at MPS, commented:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CMPS\u2019 collaboration with ABP will help open up access to major port facilities in the Celtic Sea, a key assessment criterion for the forthcoming 4.5GW Leasing Round. By working together, we will enable the creation of an integrated, lower risk delivery blueprint; one that minimises space and infrastructure requirements to accelerate and reduce cost of wind farm construction using PelaFlex.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThis MoU is one example of many relationships we are building in southwest Wales and across the markets we serve to offer a qualified and curated supply chain that both reduces risk for energy developers and increases deliverability of industrial scale projects.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is redefining what keeping Britain trading means in the greener, cleaner economy of the future. This is reflected in the launch of its sustainability strategy, \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019, which sets out ABP\u2019s plan to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations by 2040 by the latest as support large-scale infrastructure projects to enable the UK\u2019s energy transition.\u201C\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is exhibiting at stand D154 at the Global Offshore Wind trade show in Manchester from 18-19 June and Marine Power Systems will be exhibiting on stand B120.\u003C/p\u003E"
