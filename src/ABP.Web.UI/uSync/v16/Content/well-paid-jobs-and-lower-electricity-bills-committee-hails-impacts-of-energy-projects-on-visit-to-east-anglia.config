Image credit: Stephen Waller\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Chair of the Energy Security and Net Zero (ESNZ) Committee has hailed the important role East Anglia is playing in building a low-carbon energy future for Britain during a visit to key energy projects in the region.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EChair Bill Esterson MP, alongside committee members including Claire Young MP, Luke Murphy MP, and Wera Hobhouse MP, toured the Port of Lowestoft \u2013 owned and operated by Associated British Ports (ABP) \u2013 and visited Sizewell C and ScottishPower Renewables\u2019 East Anglia ONE operations and maintenance base as part of a two-day visit to the region.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBill Esterson MP, Chair of the ESNZ Committee\u003C/strong\u003E, said: \u201CThe Port of Lowestoft is an inspiring example of how the UK\u2019s ports can support the energy transition, working collaboratively with projects like Sizewell C and ScottishPower Renewables.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s impressive to see the progress being made here, from pioneering carbon capture technology to vital offshore wind energy operations. These initiatives highlight the important role East Anglia is playing in building a secure, sustainable, and low-carbon energy future for Britain. Crucially the projects we saw create well-paid jobs and can ultimately help deliver lower electricity bills.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDuring the visit, the Committee toured ABP\u2019s newly completed Lowestoft Eastern Energy Facility (LEEF), which was officially opened by Secretary of State for Energy and Net Zero, Ed Miliband MP. LEEF is set to become a critical hub for offshore wind energy operations and demonstrates ABP\u2019s commitment to enabling the energy transition.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThey also explored the innovative Direct Air Capture (DAC) demonstrator facility, based at the Port of Lowestoft which is one of the UK\u2019s first pilot projects for this cutting-edge technology, led by Sizewell C.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaul Ager, Divisional Port Manager, Associated British Ports, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe were delighted to welcome the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee to the Port of Lowestoft and showcase how ABP, alongside the likes of ScottishPower Renewables and SSE, are contributing to the UK\u2019s energy transition. The completion of the Lowestoft Eastern Energy Facility and our partnership with Sizewell C on the Direct Air Capture project underline our commitment to innovation and sustainability.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CThese projects represent not just progress for the port but a significant step forward for the region\u2019s economy and the UK\u2019s energy security.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe visit to the Port followed a tour of the main development site of Sizewell C, a new 3.2GW nuclear power station being built on the Suffolk coast. A British project, majority owned by the UK Government, Sizewell C will provide low-carbon electricity to six million homes for at least 60 years and save nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere annually.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJulia Pyke, Joint Managing Director of Sizewell C, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CIt was a pleasure to show the ESNZ Committee the significant progress we\u2019re making at Sizewell C, twelve months after starting construction here on the Suffolk coast.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CEast Anglia is setting an example of how to deliver low-carbon energy in the UK \u2013 and a big part of that is about how we\u2019re working together in the region. Sizewell C is already set to become one of the UK\u2019s biggest contributors to energy security, is climate friendly, and is making a great contribution to opportunity in the region. By working with ABP on construction support, and on building our Direct Air Capture demo plant on ABP land in Lowestoft, for example, we can have an even bigger impact.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CAnd the benefits to the region\u2019s economy are huge. Sizewell C has easily surpassed \u00A3100 million in local contracts in just our first year of construction, and we\u2019re committed to spending \u00A34.4 billion in the East of England alone across the construction period. That\u2019s a truly transformative legacy to leave for this area, as it helps to deliver the energy security we need in the UK.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Committee also visited the ScottishPower Renewables Operations and Maintenance base for the East Anglia ONE offshore wind farm, situated at the Port of Lowestoft, showcasing the port\u2019s growing role in supporting renewable energy projects in the region.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoss Ovens, ScottishPower Renewables\u2019 Managing Director for Offshore\u003C/strong\u003E, added: \u201CLowestoft is the home and heart of ScottishPower\u2019s offshore wind operations in the UK and it was great to show the Committee what we\u2019re doing to deliver a clean energy future and how that is spurring investment and supporting jobs and growth across East Anglia. Standing alongside colleagues from ABP and Sizewell gave a really powerful message to the Committee about industry\u2019s collective commitment to the region and driving the energy transition that delivers long and lasting benefits for all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Port of Lowestoft and East Anglia continue to lead the way in delivering low-carbon energy solutions that align with the UK\u2019s energy security goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E"
