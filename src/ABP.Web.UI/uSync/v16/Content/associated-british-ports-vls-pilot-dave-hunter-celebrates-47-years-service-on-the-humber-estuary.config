One of his final acts of pilotage, ahead of his retirement as a VLS (very large ships) pilot, took place earlier this month, as he brought the MV Propel Grace onto its berth at the Humber International Terminal on the Port of Immingham.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDave had originally wanted to become a draughtsman or architect when he was younger. As he was preparing to leave school, he spotted an article in a careers magazine about becoming a River Pilot, which sparked his interest in what would be an incredible career.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDave said: \u201CThe job really jumped out at me. I had never heard of a River Pilot, and it sounded really good, so I made some enquiries. I had never been to sea, neither had my father, but later I discovered that my great, great, great, great grandfather had been a pilot on the Tyne. I was able to start an apprenticeship in 1964 and haven\u2019t looked back since.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing time on the water and working through the necessary experience and qualifications, Dave became a Class 1 Humber Pilot in 1980, and 12 years later he qualified as a VLS Pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDavid said: \u201CI have loved working with the very large ships (40,000 tonnes). Being a Humber Pilot has been a wonderful career. Without doubt the Humber Estuary is one of the hardest to navigate in the UK, but the feeling that you get from completing a job really well is like no other. It is a challenging job, but when everything goes right you feel ten foot high.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking back across his 47 years Dave reckons he has completed around 200 vessel movements per year, and he has enjoyed every one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Humber Estuary is the largest harbour district in the UK and the Humber Pilotage Area stretches from the Spurn Light Float through the Humber Estuary up the River Ouse to Goole and up the river Trent to Gainsborough.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDave added: \u201COver the years I have worked with 100\u2019s of apprentices and trainees. There is a lot of support for those working towards becoming a Humber Pilot, it is a great community in which I have made lifelong friends.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAcross 2022 there were in excess of 15,000 acts of Pilotage undertaken by ABP\u2019s 100 strong team of Pilots aided by several towage companies working on the Humber. Towage and marine services company, Svitzer, who aided the MV Propel Grace, turned their water jets on to honour Dave\u2019s last VLS movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimon Bird, Director Humber, said: \u201CI would like to personally thank Dave for his incredible service to the Humber. Dave, and Marine Pilots here and around the world, carry out a vital service that supports our everyday lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the considerable experience and expertise of Marine Pilots, we can all access the commodities to build our homes, keep our lights and heating on, stock our retail sector and bring in medicines for our hospitals and pharmacies. The work Pilots carry out goes mostly unnoticed by members of the public but is key to Keeping Britain Trading.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP is one of the UK\u2019s largest Marine employers, whose professional team ensure the safe passage of vessels through the Humber Estuary.
