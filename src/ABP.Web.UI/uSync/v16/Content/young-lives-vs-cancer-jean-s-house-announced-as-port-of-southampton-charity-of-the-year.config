Charities with a strong presence in Southampton or Hampshire are nominated by employees, with all employees having the chance to vote for their preferred charity from a shortlist. As part of their support of the charity, the team at ABP Southampton will be focusing on raising funds for Jean\u0027s House, a \u0022Home from Home\u0022 facility provided by the charity.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJean\u0027s House provides a free place for families to stay when their child is undergoing cancer treatment. Staying at the home, which is near Southampton General Hospital, allows young cancer patients to be close to their loved ones, keeping the family together at a challenging time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECaitlin Kempton, ABP Marine Compliance Officer, who initially nominated Young Lives vs Cancer for ABP Southampton\u0027s charity of the year, said: \u0022I am pleased that Young Lives vs Cancer reached the final ballot for this years\u0027 charity of the year. It is a charity that is very close to my heart, and I am looking forward to supporting it through fundraising activities this year.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The charity supported my family and me while I was undergoing hospital treatment. Without my Mum\u0027s support and the support of the \u0022Home from Home\u0022, I have no doubt that my stay in the hospital would have been longer and left my family struggling financially.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESouthampton General Hospital is a specialist hospital for children and young people with cancer. It supports families across the South of England, including the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands. Jean\u0027s House helps families avoid the extra financial burden of travel, accommodation, and food costs. Families sometimes stay at Jean\u0027s House for months at a time, or just for one night, depending on their child\u0027s treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELiz Blunt, Senior Fundraising Manager at Young Lives vs Cancer, said, \u0022I have met so many families who have told me that they would not have managed financially without being able to stay at Jean\u0027s House. Our research shows that, on average, a family needs to find an extra \u00A3730 a month while their child goes through cancer treatment.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It is vital to have somewhere for families to stay free of charge and close to the hospital where their child is being treated. As a charity, we do not receive any government funding. We only have Jean\u0027s House in Southampton thanks to incredible supporters like Caitlin and ABP in Southampton.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlastair Welch, Regional Director of ABP Southampton, said,\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u0022Our charity of the year initiative is important because we can contribute to the causes that matter most to our people and at the same time bring our teams together to reach a positive fundraising target.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jean\u0027s House is a great asset to the Young Lives vs Cancer charity, ensuring that families can remain together at an unimaginable time. I am excited to be part of this year\u0027s charity and get involved with our fundraising across the port.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"
