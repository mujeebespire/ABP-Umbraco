He has worked at the Southampton Container Terminal (now DP World) and has since progressed his career with senior roles in several countries, resulting in multiple improvement initiatives across the port sector.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAndrew Dawes, Director of the Humber ports said\u003C/strong\u003E: \u201CTim is the ideal person to help us achieve our goals and to deliver the next five-year business strategy. Initially Tim will join the Humber Leadership Team reporting to me and focus his time initially on the Humber before taking on a wider role to help all ABP regions with their Continuous Improvement journey.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETim Hathaway, Head of Continuous Improvement said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CFor me I am keen to meet those who do their daily jobs as they know their job the best. Organisations have lots of ways of working and lots of ways of frustrating people, so it is about unstitching everything and looking at the way we work, which is often about innovative ideas for solving problems, which increases productivity and give our customers a better service.\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CThere are some exciting opportunities coming up in green energy, and I think we have learning to do as we transition from fossil fuel to the new fuels. It will create unfamiliar problems and challenges, and some may take months or years to fix. We will be looking at what needs to be done and how it delivers our company strategy.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETim, who is based in the Humber region, was part of ABP\u2019s extended family for five years at the Southampton Container Terminal before working for APM Terminals in Africa and the Middle East. He then went to Hong Kong, before working in Oman for several years at the Port of Salalah, leading its transformation to becoming recognised at the best port in the Middle East.\u003C/p\u003E"
