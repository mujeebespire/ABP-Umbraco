This significant milestone was marked with a plaque unveiling at an event for rail freight and maritime leaders and customers on 20 March at the Solent Stevedores\u2019 operated Solent Rail Terminal in the western docks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis major investment into the future of rail at the port has created an 18-acre facility expanding the intermodal rail transport site to broaden the service offer with laden and empty container handling, storage, maintenance, and repair within a single-site boundary \u2013 a first for the Port of Southampton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFeatures of the new site include a newly designed track layout facilitating simultaneous train arrival and departures increasing the terminal\u2019s efficiency and extending the rail loading pad by 130m. The larger intermodal site including container storage with full maintenance and repair facilities will be able to handle a 71% increase in daily services with a 125% increase in number of containers handled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new offering for deep sea shipping lines has already won an award for Driving Rail Freight Growth at the RFG Awards last year recognising companies that have helped boost rail freight growth providing a benefit to the environment and economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe construction work undertaken by contractors Ryebridge Construction has further strengthened the rail facilities for customers at the Port of Southampton giving them greater choice over their container placement and storage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStuart Cullen, Executive Chairman of Solent Stevedores, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe completion of this project marks a major shift for intermodal transport at the Port of Southampton. This is the latest project in our long-term investment programme, and it has greatly expanded our offering for container management at the port. Along with generating a significant increase in our efficiency at the rail terminal, it goes a long way to supporting the Government\u2019s targets of reaching Net Zero by 2050.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlastair Welch, Regional Director of ABP Southampton, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThis project is a great example of expanding container handling, increasing rail use, reducing reliance on HVGs, and offering new services within the port boundary. We are proud of our continued partnership with Solent Stevedores, supporting them on their journey to reduce carbon emissions both within their operations and across the wider port.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERail Minister Huw Merriman said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe railway plays a vital role in transporting goods to and from ports across the UK, keeping the country moving and boosting economic growth. That\u2019s why last year this Government set an ambitious target to grow rail freight by at least 75% by 2050.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CToday\u2019s opening of the Solent Rail Terminal demonstrates the strength of the industry and its ambitions to grow, and I\u2019m pleased that this multi-million-pound upgrade will provide the increased capacity to allow the Port of Southampton to thrive.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E"
