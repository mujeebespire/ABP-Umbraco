The ceremony took place at the ABP Pilot Station at Endeavour Quay, Gosport.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe vessels were named and blessed in a traditional ceremony by the Sailors\u2019 Society\u2019s Port Chaplin, Phil Hiscock, who was joined by the vessels\u2019 Godmothers, Helen Downing and Lucy Masters. ABP employees and representatives from Goodchild Marine were also invited to attend the blessing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the International Day for Women in Maritime, it is only fitting that two women who have served the maritime sector are recognised as Godmothers for these vital vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHelen has worked in various roles at ABP for over 25 years and is currently Executive Assistant to Alastair Welch, ABP Regional Director for Southampton. Lucy Masters is married to ABP Southampton Harbour Master Steve Masters, and it is a Southampton maritime tradition that the Harbour Master\u2019s wife is given the title of Godmother to such a significant vessel. Lucy has had a significant career in the maritime sector and spent almost 20 years as a Merchant Navy Cadet Training Officer and today works as a Lead Recruiter within the Cruise sector for Faststream Recruitment Group, a specialist recruiting agency for the maritime industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMajestic and Mary Rose are the final two of three new launches for ABP\u2019s Southampton region and three of nine across ABP\u2019s ports, representing a total investment of around \u00A39m. Each faster, more fuel-efficient vessel delivers an approximate 40% fuel saving through an innovative forward \u2018beak\u2019 and double chine hull design that enables the vessel to cut through the waves. The vessels are constructed in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, by Goodchild Marine. Majestic and Mary Rose will join Mayflower (the first of the new vessels named last year) at the ABP Pilot Station in Gosport. The three Pilot Vessels safely transport Southampton Marine Pilots to and from ships entering and leaving the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteve Masters, Southampton Harbour Master, said:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt is fantastic to have the three vessels in use across Southampton Water and the Solent. The vessels take our Marine Pilots back and forth to board/debark large vessels and support our Pilot team when bringing in the largest container, oil tanker and cruise ships through the Solent and Southampton Water. To have three in service will provide vital support throughout the busier summer months.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E"
