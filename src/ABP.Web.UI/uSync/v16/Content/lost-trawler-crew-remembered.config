The story was uncovered by author Richard Jones while researching for his upcoming book about the Yorkshire Belle boat sinking in a mine explosion in the entrance to the Humber Estuary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon Bird, Regional Director for the Humber\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CWe\u2019re delighted that we could assist Richard in giving the plaque an honourable home at the port from which it sailed. It was appropriate it was placed next to our Royal Naval Patrol Service memorial, which lists those men and vessels who were lost during the second world war.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Othello is named on there and was one of many trawlers requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used in minesweeping and boom defence vessel duties along the east coast. The RNPS was sometimes known as Harry Tate\u0027s Navy or Churchill\u2019s Pirates, and they lost more vessels than any other branch of the Royal Navy.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERichard Jones, author\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u0022I am extremely pleased that Grimsby is recognising this forgotten tragedy, and this could not have been done without the help of ABP who gave me permission and the UK Operational Support Services Ltd who paid for the plaque itself. To have a memorial that is now twinned with that of the Yorkshire Belle\u0027s in Bridlington now makes sure that the sinking of these two vessels will always be remembered.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETragically 12 people onboard the Othello were killed, and their bodies were never found. The victims who lost their lives on the Othello are as follows: Keith Bean, Donald Blair, William Coupe, Herbert Crumpler, David Jones, Albert Laken, Fredrick McDonald, Frank Roper, James Russell, Walter Trench, John Wakefield, and Albert Williams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGrimsby served as a minesweeping base in both world wars with trawlers being turned into minesweepers and boom defence duties. The first trawlers to be trialled for such duties were gifted to the admiralty in 1908 by George Alward, who was based at the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FV Othello was owned by Forward Steam Fishing Company Ltd. until its requisition in 1939, and before that had been owned by Alfred Bannister (Trawlers) Ltd who it was built for in 1907. She was already a veteran of the 1914-19 campaign for the Royal Navy before being returned to her owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 800 trawlers from Grimsby and Hull fishing fleets were used in the Royal Naval Reserve, and over 200 were lost. The Othello had been working as a boom defence vessel, whose primary function was to lay anti-submarine nets in the Humber.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plaque is displayed on a concrete plinth within a gravel garden created by ABP\u2019s civil engineering team.\u003C/p\u003E"
