Ports and logistics have traditionally been male orientated and at ABP we are challenging that old-fashioned perception as we increasingly recruit more women to our crucial industry.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Humber ports we have many females working across a range of roles, some front line, some office based, all bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and expertise, and not all with a maritime background. We hope this campaign inspires people to think of a career with ABP which will be truly rewarding as we help boost growth around Britain\u2019s coast.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brochure features a range of roles showing the opportunities, including engineering, marine, and operations. The four Humber ports handle more than 58 million tonnes of cargo between them annually and are proud to be offering such exciting roles in a demanding industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmy Airey, Port Operative, who features in the new brochure joined Associated British Ports after working in mental health. She added: \u201CI\u2019m a single mother of two children and wanted a job whose working hours were flexible enough to allow me to parent and earn a wage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CI\u2019ve always felt I\u2019ve had to prove myself as a woman and it\u2019s not the case here. The jobs are not exclusively for men, if you want it, go for it as anyone can do it.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo local schools will also participate in the launch event and will meet colleagues and hear about some of the jobs on offer at the port. They will also get an opportunity to see some of the large cranes and experience what it is like sitting in the driving seat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brochure can be downloaded from the ABP website \u003Ca href=\u0022/news-and-media/publications-download/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E or picked up at a career\u2019s fayre.
