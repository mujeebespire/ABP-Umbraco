With a female protagonist, the film invites audiences to see the world through the eyes of a woman who progresses through different stages of her life and maritime career, whilst witnessing and helping deliver various green energy infrastructure projects enabled by ABP\u2019s ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe travels from Immingham up on the Humber, where she sees the growth of green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage to Port Talbot in Wales, where the exciting floating offshore wind industry is in bloom. Along the way, she meets different animals from a seal to kittiwakes, all serving as a reminder that industrial progress needs to go hand in hand with protecting biodiversity to create a sustainable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn original scored soundtrack was created especially for the project as well as a voiceover delivered by a woman in her 50s, in an effort to address the noticeable absence of these types of voices in the majority of B2B corporate videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMax Harris, ABP Head of Strategy and Sustainability\u003C/strong\u003E, said: \u201CWe are very proud of what we have achieved with the \u2018The Voyage\u2019. We see it as a tool to highlight the important role ports are playing in decarbonising the UK. It was a very rewarding project and I would like to thank our team and Polar Media who helped bring this vision to life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe hope the film is accessible for people from all ages and backgrounds who may be unfamiliar with what we do in the ports industry. The low-poly animated style also set the creative for the other assets in our \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019 sustainability strategy campaign, including school competition posters, documents and more.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of its goal to appeal to the younger generation, this video also reached school pupils aged 8-10 years across England, Scotland and Wales. To achieve this, ABP launched a sustainability-themed \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019 school competition in May 2023, encouraging pupils living in coastal communities to make their schools more sustainable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrawing inspiration from ABP\u2019s own Net Zero sustainability strategy, the competition was open to pupils across the UK. To help generate ideas, pupils were encouraged to watch the \u2018The Voyage\u2019 video and read an age-appropriate strategy summary, which aims to convey the official ABP strategy\u2019s key messages and focus areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, biodiversity and waste and water management in a more accessible way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnnabelle, the 9-year-old competition winner from a school in Lowestoft\u003C/strong\u003E, said: \u0022I felt shocked when I won it, because normally I never win things. The competition was fun to do, and I really enjoyed it. It was great talking about what we could do to help the school and the environment\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpread across ABP\u2019s regions, participating schools were situated in coastal communities in the Humber, Solent, East Anglia, Southwest England, Scotland and Wales. Winners and runners up were selected in each of these locations and received prizes including book vouchers and school donations. Winners were also be invited to attend ABP\u2019s Annual Review afternoon tea reception at the Houses of Parliament in London.\u202F\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKathy Tsola, Co-head of VFX and Animation department at Polar Media\u003C/strong\u003E, commented: \u201CWe loved working with ABP on \u0060The Voyage\u0060,\u00A0creating our protagonist\u0027s journey through sustainability. As creators and artists, we always find it exciting to work on projects that combine a great story\u00A0with characters and scenic environments,\u00A0but the sustainable message of the story as well as the impact we are seeing the film have on coastal communities and schools make this extra rewarding.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E"
