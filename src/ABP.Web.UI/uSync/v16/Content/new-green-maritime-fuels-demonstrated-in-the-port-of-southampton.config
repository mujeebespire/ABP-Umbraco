      "content": "\u003Cp\u003EToday, Fortescue Green Pioneer completed a groundbreaking demonstration of ammonia fuel usage in the Port of Southampton, marking a first for the UK and Europe. The demonstration highlighted the vessel\u0027s operational safety, ensured regulatory compliance, and provided training for the crew on how to operate an ammonia-fuelled vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Port of Southampton welcomed the Fortescue Green Pioneer, the world\u0027s first dual-fuel ammonia-powered vessel, during its inaugural visit to the UK on Saturday. The ship had undergone regulatory inspections over the last few days at the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a zero-carbon fuel, ammonia has the potential to revolutionise the shipping industry by lowering greenhouse gas emissions, marking a significant step forward in maritime decarbonisation. Ammonia can be made synthetically by combining nitrogen with hydrogen, in a process called ammonia synthesis. When this process is completed using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy, the result is green ammonia. Fortescue Green Pioneer is a collaborative effort between Fortescue and key maritime stakeholders to demonstrate the feasibility of ammonia as a sustainable marine fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHarbour Master for the Port of Southampton Steve Masters said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We are proud that Fortescue Green Pioneer has chosen Southampton as its first port of call in Europe. I have been closely collaborating with the team on board and the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency to ensure they have everything necessary to carry out demonstrations of the vessel under ammonia power. This marks a significant advancement in maritime decarbonisation, and it is exciting to see the Port of Southampton leading the way in accommodating vessels powered by greener fuels.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr Andrew Forrest AO, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CWe have brought the Fortescue Green Pioneer to the UK to deliver a simple message: the technology for green ammonia powered shipping engines exists now. This vessel encapsulates the innovation and character that has defined Fortescue\u2019s mission to lead the world beyond fossil fuels. Over the coming months, global shipping regulators at the International Maritime Organisation have the chance to fast-track shipping\u2019s move away from dirty bunker fuel and embrace Real Zero fuel standards.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWith the right character and leadership, they can chart a course towards a more sustainable future for the planet and advance a dramatic reduction in shipping costs through the widespread adoption and scaling of renewable sources. This opportunity cannot be missed.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMCA Director of UK Customer Services Lars Lippuner said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CDecarbonisation in the maritime sector is a huge priority for the UK and shipping, and Fortescue Green Pioneer successfully demonstrates what a future of cleaner shipping could look like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CThe MCA will conduct thorough inspections and checks to ensure the vessel\u0027s safety and operational readiness for its onward journey. It has been a pleasure working in collaboration with Fortescue to bring this innovative vessel to Europe, and we are excited that the shift to a more sustainable marine fuel and a world\u2019s first is being showcased here in the UK.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe call of Fortescue Green Pioneer is the latest example of the Port of Southampton\u2019s activities in green maritime. Next on the agenda is the Maritime UK Solent Coastal Powerhouse event. The event will feature prominent speakers, including the Minister for Aviation, Maritime and Security, Mike Kane as well as a panel discussion on port sustainability and seminar sessions on Clean Maritime and Autonomous Maritime. One of the key highlights is ABP\u2019s EVA Southampton Innovation Exchange in partnership with innovation platform and investor, Plug and Play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EVA Southampton Innovation Exchange is part of the \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022/sustainability/energy-ventures-accelerator/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 title=\u0022Energy Ventures Accelerator\u0022\u003EEnergy Ventures Accelerator (EVA) programme\u003C/a\u003E, supporting ABP\u2019s ambitious \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://readyfortomorrow.abports.co.uk/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003E\u00A32B green growth and decarbonisation plans.\u003C/a\u003E With a focus on maritime decarbonisation, the day will highlight Southampton as a pivotal hub for the UK\u2019s energy transition, showcasing cutting-edge innovation and collaboration opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Ends -\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E"
