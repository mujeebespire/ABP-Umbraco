The vessel call was the first usage of an agreement signed earlier this year between ABP and the Ministry of Defence providing the Armed Forces with options to use ABP\u2019s ports around Britain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Eddystone was transporting hundreds of vehicles and pieces of equipment belonging to 7 Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team (the Desert Rats) back in the UK from this year\u2019s largest NATO deployment, Exercise Steadfast Dart. The Port of Immingham provides a great location for unloading, given its proximity to the relevant Army bases in the north of England.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAndrew Dawes, Regional Director of the Humber ports said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe Humber ports are in a key strategic position on the UK east coast, and this is a great honour to be offering Immingham to support the UK\u2019s Armed Forces. Not only does this weekend\u2019s port call provide a local and cost-effective operation for the Desert Rats, it also gives all parties valuable experience of operating in different ABP locations and the options our port locations offer to scale up.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERichard Parkinson, ABP\u2019s Senior MoD Engagement Lead said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe discharge of the military hardware was the first since ABP signed the agreement. As the UK\u0027s largest port operator, our strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence gives it additional sea mounting resilience and enables seamless deployment and recovery of military vehicles and equipment across the nation, ensuring readiness for overseas missions.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChief of Defence Logistics and Support, Vice Admiral Andy Kyte CB, said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CI\u2019m delighted to see the first demonstration of the new agreement between MOD and ABP come to life at Immingham port. This agreement marks a significant step in boosting the resilience, efficiency, and agility of Defence\u2019s Sea Mounting Capability by leveraging ABP\u2019s national port estate. The partnership with ABP plays a pivotal role in fortifying the UK Strategic Base, a cornerstone essential for Defence to effectively deploy, sustain, and recover force elements.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUp until this new Agreement, the Field Army had been focused solely on using the Sea Mounting Centre at Marchwood near Southampton. While Marchwood will continue to be developed as a truly capable location, the Agreement means that the Armed Forces have a wider choice of locations, providing public spending cost savings, better operational efficiency and capability resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike many of ABP\u2019s ports, Immingham was constructed to accommodate naval vessels. In 1912 the lock was built for the dreadnought class of battleships, which were used during World War I. Immingham\u2019s Dock Office still bears its naval base name HMS Beaver II, which was the headquarters for 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the First World War and a base for the British D class submarine. In the Second World War, Lord Louis Mountbatten stayed here while HMS Kelly was undergoing repairs in the Humber Graving Dock in 1939.\u003C/p\u003E"
