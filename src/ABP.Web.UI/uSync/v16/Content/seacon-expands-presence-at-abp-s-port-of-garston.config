The expansion reaffirms Seacon\u2019s commitment to ABP\u2019s Port of Garston and marks a new chapter in their successful partnership with ABP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally founded as Stanton Grove in 1983, Seacon (SG) Limited has established itself as a key player in the forest products handling industry, with a strong focus on port-based terminal operations. In February 2022, ABP collaborated with Seacon to facilitate the reestablishment of its northern base at the Port of Garston, a decision that has proven fruitful for both parties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe latest development in this ongoing collaboration has seen Seacon (SG) Limited take a significant step forward in its expansion efforts. ABP is proud to announce that Seacon has committed to eight years and significantly expanded its presence at the Port, growing its footprint in just over one year from 12,500 square-feet to an impressive 150,000 square-feet of prime port real estate. This expansion reflects the increasing demand for Seacon\u0027s services and its ability to meet the evolving needs of the paper and pulp industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the cornerstones of this expansion has been the addition of three new state-of-the-art sheds by SpacioTempo, a renowned leader in temporary and semi-permanent modular building solutions. These new facilities have enabled Seacon (SG) Limited to enhance its operational capabilities and capacity significantly and rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESarah Williams, Senior Surveyor, Wales and Short Sea Ports, ABP\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CSince returning to the Port of Garston last year, we have been delighted to see Seacon (SG) Limited continue to grow its presence at the Port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201COver the past couple of years, ABP has invested significantly in equipment and infrastructure, such as additional covered and external storage, which is enabling customers such as Seacon to continue to offer services at the highest standard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This expansion and lease extension highlights the strength of our partnership with Seacon, and reinforces the Port of Garston\u0027s strategic location on the north bank of the Mersey, which offers the ideal gateway to the industrial heartlands of the North West of England.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMartin Phillips,\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ECEO, Seacon (SG)\u003C/strong\u003E, said: \u201CABP\u2019s recent investment in the Port of Garston, as well as their ability to provide flexible solutions, has helped to facilitate our rapid expansion.
