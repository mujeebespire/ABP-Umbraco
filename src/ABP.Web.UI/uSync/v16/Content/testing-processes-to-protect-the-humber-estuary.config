ABP is the\u00A0Statutory and Competent Harbour Authority for the Humber Estuary and is responsible for ensuring the safety of marine operations within the ports and estuary. As part of its duty of care to the Humber, each year ABP Humber conduct an Incident Management Exercise to test the Oil Spill Contingency Plan \u201CHumber Clean\u201D.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe oil spill scenario was simulated on the release of approximately 5mt of DERV, east of the Immingham Oil Terminal, due to the rupture of an 80k litre road tanker at an adjacent site which entered the Estuary via the North Beck Drain. As in previous years, this was a fictional scenario used by the team and was not based on any actual incidents at the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMarine Response Centre team leaders worked on individual responsibilities to move through the exercise, testing the many processes in place to ensure a quick containment and management of the scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a first response to any notification of an oil spill, ABP Tier 1 teams can be deployed to tackle the spill. Adler and Allan operate as Tier 2 contractors for ABP, and upon their arrival would support the incident management team with containment and clear-up operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis training opportunity enabled ABP\u2019s Marine Response Centre located at Grimsby Port Office to test many aspects of incident management including communications, \u2018Send Word Now\u2019 for cascaded alerts, and on this occasion, a limited management structure within the OSCP plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA full communications check was completed by ABP with organisations such as the Humber Emergency Planning Services, Environment Agency and the MCA and a live test spraying was conducted by the Pilot Launch Humber Venus to ensure that we fulfil our responsibilities within MCA guidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaul Bristowe, Head of Marine for ABP\u2019s Humber ports, said\u003C/strong\u003E: \u201CHUMEX provides an ideal opportunity to test the team and processes to ensure we have a safe and effective oil spill response at high readiness on the Humber.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Humber Estuary is an important place and holds many designations for the habitats and wildlife, both resident and migratory, that can be found here. It\u2019s also a busy industrial area. The exercise is a vital piece of protection to ensure that any incident can be dealt with safely and quickly to prevent damage to the environment.\u201D \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E"
