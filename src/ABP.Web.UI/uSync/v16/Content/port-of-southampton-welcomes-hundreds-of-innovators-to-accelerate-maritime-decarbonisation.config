It featured a speech by Mary Carmen Barrios, Senior Vice President Operations at Wallenius Wilhelmsen and a panel discussion focused on maritime decarbonisation, led by ABP Business Development Manager, Lex Hanham, with a range of expert perspectives from HMM, Sallaum Lines, Carnival UK and UCL\u2019s Energy Institute.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlastair Welch, ABP\u2019s Regional Director for Southampton, said: \u201CToday, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate Southampton\u2019s place at the heart of maritime decarbonisation in the UK. Southampton has been a leader in UK port sustainability through being the first port to deploy shorepower at scale and by publishing a comprehensive air quality strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAt ABP, we are committed to leading positive change when it comes to maritime decarbonisation both through our sustainability strategy \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019 and initiatives like EVA. We are developing the infrastructure to support green shipping and working with our partners to turn ambition into reality.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe themes of innovation and sustainability were also reflected in Maritime Minister Mike Kane\u2019s keynote speech at the Summit, who said: \u201CWe have just announced our plan for shipping to become net zero by 2050, and it\u2019s great to see ports like ABP embrace these ambitions by going even further and faster to decarbonise.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s a pleasure to join the Coastal Powerhouse Summit and come together with leading innovators across the industry so we can drive forward the progress needed to clean up maritime, establish the UK as a clean energy superpower and drive economic growth across the country.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EVA Southampton Innovation Exchange is part of a nationwide programme \u2013 \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022/sustainability/energy-ventures-accelerator/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EABP\u2019s Energy Ventures Accelerator\u003C/a\u003E, run in partnership with innovation platform Plug and Play. The programme provides a way for ABP to explore opportunities with high potential clean energy hardware startups. Since its launch in June last year, ABP has spoken to hundreds of startups and has run four major innovation events in London, Hull, Cardiff and now \u2013 Southampton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEVA complements ABP\u2019s sustainability strategy, \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019, which sets out ABP\u2019s target of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations by 2040, as well as supporting ABP customers\u2019 Net Zero ambitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EVA Southampton Innovation Exchange provided the stage for ABP to announce its intention to work with green maritime innovators Seabound and STAX Engineering to explore opportunities to capture at-berth emissions while vessels are in port. ABP is currently engaging with key shipping customers looking at technical and economic feasibility with a view to deploying the technology in early 2026.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMax Harris, ABP\u2019s Group Head of Strategy \u0026amp; Sustainability, who leads the EVA programme, commented: \u201CI am delighted to announce that as part of ABP\u2019s broader strategic ambitions, we are excited to be working with UK carbon capture startup Seabound and California emissions capture service provider STAX Engineering, who are integrating their solutions to minimise both air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 helping to make shipping and ports more sustainable.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESeabound and STAX Engineering\u2019s technology integrates through a two-step process. First, STAX connects to a ship\u2019s exhaust pipe(s) and filters out 99% of particulate matter and 95% of NOx, releasing a purified gas. Next, the purified gas is directed into Seabound\u2019s capture unit, which isolates and stores the ship\u2019s carbon and sulphur emissions before the cleaned exhaust gas enters the atmosphere, reducing the vessel\u2019s overall greenhouse gas footprint. The two companies have recently announced a trial collaboration at the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles in California to offer an end-to-end emissions capture solution to shipping lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlisha Fredriksson, CEO \u0026amp; Co-Founder of Seabound, said: \u201CShipping is a notoriously difficult industry to decarbonise, which is why collaborations like this one between ABP, Seabound, and STAX can be so impactful and game-changing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWhile our focus at Seabound has traditionally been to capture carbon onboard ocean-going vessels, we\u2019re also excited to leverage our technology for this new opportunity: capturing carbon from ships while they\u2019re in port. By teaming up with ABP to expand deployments of our integrated technology with STAX Engineering at the Port of Southampton, we can offer vessel owners and operators a practical way to reduce emissions\u2014and design a solution that\u2019s scalable port-wide from day one.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike Walker, CEO, STAX Engineering, added: \u201COur integrated solution can service all vessel configurations without the need for ship modifications or expensive retrofitting. We provide an immediate solution for harmful pollutants, making shipping more sustainable right here and right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAt STAX, we firmly believe collaborative innovation with port partners and other technical solutions is the catalyst for cleaner ports worldwide. With our emissions capture and control technology, we\u2019re eager to work alongside ABP and their customers to deliver comprehensive emissions solutions that move the UK closer to a clean-air future.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the session, conference guests also heard from a range of clean energy startups, including:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.linkedin.com/company/seabound/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ESeabound\u003C/a\u003E \u2013 UK startup offering an onboard carbon capture system for vessels, which removes up to 95% of CO\u2082 from a ship\u2019s exhaust, providing a scalable decarbonisation solution both at berth and at sea.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.linkedin.com/company/staxengineering/posts/?feedView=all\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 data-anchor=\u0022?feedView=all\u0022\u003ESTAX Engineering\u003C/a\u003E \u2013 a US-based company offering cutting-edge emissions capture and control as a service.
