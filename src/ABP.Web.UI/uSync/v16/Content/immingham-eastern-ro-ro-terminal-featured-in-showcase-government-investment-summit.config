IERRT provides a more resilient and sustainable supply chain solution option for UK businesses and is an important inward investment opportunity for UK logistics infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHenrik L. Pedersen, CEO of ABP\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CWe are delighted that the Development Consent Order (DCO) for the Immingham Eastern Ro-Ro Terminal (IERRT) has been granted. This approval marks a significant milestone in our mission to Keep Britain Trading through enhancing the UK\u0027s logistics infrastructure and bolstering trade capacity across the North Sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe IERRT project is a key component of our strategy to strengthen the UK\u0027s supply chains and improve trade connectivity, whilst also bringing substantial economic benefits including the creation of hundreds of jobs during construction and ongoing operations. We are confident that, with the necessary adjustments, we can proceed on schedule to begin construction in 2025 and complete the project by 2026.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENiclas M\u00E5rtensson, CEO of Stena Line\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CWe are very pleased that the Secretary of State has approved the new RoRo terminal at the Port of Immingham. The port is of great strategic importance to Stena Line and we\u2019re looking forward to building on the success we have seen in the unaccompanied freight market. This is a long-term commitment for us and will be integral to expanding our freight operations on our routes between the UK and Continental Europe to serve demand.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon Bird, Regional Director of the Humber ports\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CThis is fantastic news for the Humber and the UK more generally. The IERRT development significantly increases the Port of Immingham\u2019s capability and capacity for handling unaccompanied freight units across the North Sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis additional capacity is required to meet the identified growing commercial demand whilst at the same time strengthening the Humber Estuary\u2019s contribution to an effective, efficient, competitive and resilient UK Ro-Ro freight sector. IERRT also responds to the trend for larger RoRo vessels, requiring larger port infrastructure and landside space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs well as supporting and growing jobs in the businesses using IERRT, the project itself is the source of additional employment. It will create c700 jobs during the construction phase and then c200 permanent jobs once fully operational.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBusiness and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds\u003C/strong\u003E said: \u201CGlobal investors should be in no doubt that under this new government Britain is truly the best place to do business. The record-breaking investment total secured at today\u2019s Summit marks a major vote of confidence in the UK and our stability dividend across industry and innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re determined to deliver economic growth in every part of the UK and these investments, together with our forthcoming Industrial Strategy, will give global businesses the certainty they need as we lead the charge for the innovation and jobs of the future.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP and Stena Line are leading players in the maritime sector that is vital for enabling the growth of a maritime nation such as the UK. We have both been playing a crucial trade enabling role for decades and are ambitious to invest and grow our contributions further. IERRT is one tangible way in which we will achieve this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIERRT is the proposed construction and operation of a new Roll-on/Roll-off cargo facility on the eastern side of the Port of Immingham within the existing statutory port estate. It is a \u00A3200m\u002B project, with investment coming from both Stena Line and ABP. The DCO has been approved with certain conditions which Associated British Ports (ABP) will consider in detail in the coming weeks.\u003C/p\u003E"
