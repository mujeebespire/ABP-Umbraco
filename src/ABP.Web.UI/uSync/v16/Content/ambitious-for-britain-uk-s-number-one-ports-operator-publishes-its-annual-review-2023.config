      "content": "\u003Cp\u003EAssociated British Ports (ABP), the UK\u2019s leading ports group, has published its \u003Ca rel=\u0022noopener\u0022 href=\u0022/media/qk0i2rjq/abp-annual-review-2023.pdf\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnnual Review 2023\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. Marking the company\u2019s key developments over the past twelve months, the Review lays out ABP\u2019s \u2018Ambitious for Britain\u2019 agenda across areas such as handling \u00A3157 billion of trade, enabling the UK clean energy transition and catalysing growth in coastal communities and industrial locations across Britain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ABP Annual Review 2023 demonstrates how ABP has continued to adapt and innovate against a backdrop of evolving trade patterns, geopolitical challenges and climate change. Launched during Maritime Safety Week (3-7\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E July), the Annual Review illustrates ABP\u2019s important role as an ambitious business and sustainability leader in the maritime sector.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe central theme of the publication is \u2018Ambitious for Britain\u2019, as ABP continues to drive economic growth and prosperity, built upon strong foundations of safety, people and a determined sustainability mindset. Handing 27% of all UK port volumes in value, ABP is the UK\u2019s number one ports operator, supporting over 166,000 jobs in industrial sectors nationally through the \u00A313bn of manufacturing exports the group\u2019s 21 ports handle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June this year, ABP won the \u2018Innovation in Safety\u2019 Award at Multimodal 2023, for its bespoke Virtual Reality (VR) health and safety training, demonstrating cross-industry recognition of ABP\u2019s leading role in the ports sector. However, ABP has been on the forefront in safety innovation for many years, becoming the first UK ports company to introduce Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) especially designed for women in 2019, leading the way for many other transport-related businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EABP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Henrik L. Pedersen said: \u201CThis has been a very special year for us, as it saw the launch of our net-zero sustainability strategy, \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019, which outlines our plan to invest \u00A32 billion covering decarbonisation of our own port operations by 2040 and creation of port infrastructure supporting our customers\u2019 large-scale green energy infrastructure projects.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201COver the past 12 months, we have invested millions in our ports as well as supporting safety innovations and our people. I am proud of what we have achieved, working with our partners across industry and civil society. As we look towards the future, it is an important time to be ambitious for Britain.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaritime Minister Baroness Vere said: \u201CAs a maritime nation our country relies on ports as critical gateways to the rest of the world, connecting us with goods and services. In a changing world it is clear that the role of ports is expanding, becoming a central component to the net-zero energy transition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CIt is fantastic to see ABP demonstrate leadership on sustainability, which will help accelerate the positive change we need to remain at the forefront of the sector.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis year, ABP has invited the winners of its UK-wide \u2018Ready for Tomorrow\u2019 competition to create sustainable schools to the Annual Review Launch in Parliament. Excellent entries were made by pupils aged 8-10 years, living in relevant ABP coastal communities in the Humber, Solent, East Anglia, South West England, Scotland and Wales.\u003C/p\u003E"
