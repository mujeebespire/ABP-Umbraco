All credit to Mia who is very ambitious and wants to progress in her career with us. We\u2019re proud that she has achieved this milestone and look forward to more to come.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CWe want to increase the number of women in the ports industry and are committed to promoting diversity and fostering inclusivity. We have initiatives aimed at improving recruitment to demystify what has been traditionally seen as a male operated world and have been the first port operator to introduce women\u2019s PPE. Our message is clear \u2013 there are roles at the ports for women.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMia Allen, Port Operative, who has worked for ABP for over a year after leaving a job in a fish and chip shop, said: \u201CI wanted to train on the ship to shore as there\u2019s so much to learn about the crane and ship. The biggest challenge was the swing on the crane and going over the water, but it doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CYou must focus and look out for the ship\u2019s crew and the deck tally, and it involves clear communication. It\u2019s a heavy bit of kit and you must be prepared for the ship moving. I\u2019ve thrown myself into this as I want to progress. I enjoy the fact I can do a few hours on the crane and a stint on the tugs.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe credits her father, Mark, who has worked at the port for 20 years and trained Mia on how to use the crane, though another tester was brought in for the examination. Mia added \u201CIt was my dad\u2019s dream that one day he\u2019d train me, and I\u2019d be working here alongside him. I always told him no it would be too boring, but it\u2019s not. I love it as I\u2019ve got a great gang around me, and we all get on well. Dad was really delighted when I passed the test. I just want to keep growing and accomplish more things.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ship to shore cranes arrived in 2020 as part of a huge financial investment in the expansion of the container terminal to maximise efficiencies and improve customer service. It also included six electric rubber tyred gantry cranes in a \u00A333 million upgrade. The Humber ports are an important gateway for the short sea container routes from Europe.\u003C/p\u003E"
