We\u2019re delighted that it has been restored to its former glory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CGrimsby was a major centre for the minesweeping crews, mainly fishermen who joined up as they had the local knowledge of the Estuary and the North Sea. They earnt the nickname Harry Tate\u2019s Navy, which was jargon for something amateurish after an old music hall entertainer who played a clumsy comic. They were anything but amateurs and became well respected by the Navy for their courage and resourcefulness. This is a fitting tribute to those men.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDale Wells from the Turntable Gallery said:\u003C/strong\u003E \u201CThe Turntable Gallery was delighted to be awarded the incredible opportunity to preserve the memorial to the memories of those valiant minesweepers who lost their lives, clearing the estuary and beyond, of enemy mines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAs part of the gallery\u0027s ongoing commitment to preserving out material heritage, and restoring the artifacts of our shared past, this project was one we relished. The task required sympathetic cleaning, re-establishing the worn lettering, and replacing the lost badges. The latter involving extensive research and contact with specialists in the field. These new ceramic pieces have been sourced from Italian artisans, and now adorn the central stone. \u201C\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CTo restore this important monument and preserve its legacy for future generations to remember these heroes by, has felt incredibly poignant, considering the hardships people face to this day, in the channel. Working on repainting the lettering of the faded names, and learning a little of the lives they lived, and left behind, has made their stories incredibly immediate. The least we can do is ensure the record of their passing is preserved.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWork on the memorial has included recolouring the letters and having three new replacement badges made for the centrepiece.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGrimsby was a minesweeper base in both world wars and in 1908 provided two trawlers to the Admiralty for minesweeping tests. The memorial is to the memory of the 2,385 men who during World War Two have no grave but the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original plaque dedicated in 1939 to those who swept the seas is located on the western side of the Dock Tower after a campaign by Dorothy Clapham, who wrote the Lavendar Column in the local newspaper. It was paid for by Grimsby businessmen, Mr J Doig and Mr A Phillips.\u003C/p\u003E"
